	abstract = {Understanding the inﬂuences of forest management practices on wildﬁre severity is critical in ﬁre-prone ecosystems of the western United States. Newly available geospatial data sets characterizing vegetation, fuels, topography, and burn severity offer new opportunities for studying fuel treatment effectiveness at regional to national scales. In this study, we used ordinary least-squares ({OLS}) regression and sequential autoregression ({SAR}) to analyze fuel treatment effects on burn severity for three recent wildﬁres: the Camp 32 ﬁre in western Montana, the School ﬁre in southeastern Washington, and the Warm ﬁre in northern Arizona. Burn severity was measured using differenced normalized burn ratio ({dNBR}) maps developed by the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. Geospatial data sets from the {LANDFIRE} project were used to control for preﬁre variability in canopy cover, fuels, and topography. Across all three ﬁres, treatments that incorporated prescribed burning were more effective than thinning alone. Treatment effect sizes were lower, and standard errors were higher in the {SAR} models than in the {OLS} models. Spatial error terms in the {SAR} models indirectly controlled for confounding variables not captured in the {LANDFIRE} data, including spatiotemporal variability in ﬁre weather and landscape-level effects of reduced ﬁre severity outside the treated areas. This research demonstrates the feasibility of carrying out assessments of fuel treatment effectiveness using geospatial data sets and highlights the potential for using spatial autoregression to control for unmeasured confounding factors.},

We compared the ability of 16 frequently-used factors to predict extinction risk for 45 vertebrate taxa. Median times to extinction were estimated using taxon-speciﬁc stochastic population models. Population size (N) and trend were clearly the best correlates of extinction risk in our data set. Stepwise multiple regression with additive and interaction terms identiﬁed N , N Â trend, plus taxonomic level, number of sub-populations Â N Â trend, number of oﬀspring (O) and N Â O as predictors, and explained 70\% of the variation. Trend was important in large, but not in small populations. Population size is the most important data to collect for threatened species and with trend should be the major focus in endangered species categorization and state of the environment reporting.},

	abstract = {Empirical knowledge of ecosystem stability and diversity-stability relationships is mostly based on the analysis of temporal variability of population and ecosystem properties. Variability, however, often depends on external factors that act as disturbances, making it difficult to compare its value across systems and relate it to other stability concepts. Here we show how variability, when viewed as a response to stochastic perturbations, can reveal inherent stability properties of ecological communities, with clear connections with other stability notions. This requires abandoning one-dimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of  variability values associated to a given community, reflecting the whole set of perturbations that can generate variability. Against the vertiginous dimensionality of the perturbation set, we show that a generic variability-abundance pattern emerges  from community assembly, which relates variability to the abundance of perturbed species. As a consequence, the response to stochastic immigration is governed by rare species while common species drive the response to environmental perturbations. In particular, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes can lead to opposite diversity-stability patterns, which can be understood from basic statistics of the abundance distribution. Our work shows that a multidimensional perspective on variability allows one to better appreciate the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.},

Those biodiversity criteria and indicators which formed part of a much broader initial assessment by the Center for International Forestry Research ({CIFOR}) (Prabhu et al. 1996) were found to be deficient. This Working Paper contains specific proposals for biodiversity criteria and indicators. These proposals originated from a workshop of experts, and are intended to be adapted and refined for use in specific situations.},

	shorttitle = {Assessing forest sustainability},
	abstract = {This article aims to assess the sustainability of forestry in Spain at provincial scale from two points of view: ﬁrst, a multidimensional perspective considering the three classical dimensions of sustainability – environmental, economic and social – and, second, an integrative approach estimating a global index for forest sustainability. While the construction of such a global index is methodologically difﬁcult and arguable, it could be very useful to land planners when drawing up and reviewing forestry and environmental policies. The global index of forest sustainability suggested in this study is calculated for the ﬁfty Spanish provinces, based on a selection of twenty indicators. The majority of them (thirteen) relate to environmental dimension, four to economic dimension and three to social dimension. Numerous statistics and cartographic sources are used. A methodology is proposed based on grouping selected indicators according to three intermediate composite indicators and, subsequently, a global super-index. Cluster analysis establishes four different types of provinces according to their forest sustainability. According to the global sustainability index, part of the forests of the Mediterranean coast, those located near large inland cities and in southern Galicia appear to be less sustainable as a consequence of land artiﬁcialisation processes and forest ﬁres. Conversely, Atlantic and Pyrenees forests, and those of the northern Plateau are more sustainable due to their relative success in keeping forest traditional uses and containing emerging threats.},
