	abstract = {Social-ecological systems (SES) are complex adaptive systems. Social-ecological system phenomena, such as regime shifts, transformations, or traps, emerge from interactions among and between human and nonhuman entities within and across scales. Analyses of SES phenomena thus require approaches that can account for (1) the intertwinedness of social and ecological processes and (2) the ways they jointly give rise to emergent social-ecological patterns, structures, and dynamics that feedback on the entities and processes that generated them. We have developed a framework of linked action situations (AS) as a tool to capture those interactions that are hypothesized to have jointly and dynamically generated a social-ecological phenomenon of interest. The framework extends the concept of an action situation to provide a conceptualization of SES that focusses on social-ecological interactions and their links across levels. The aim of our SE-AS (social-ecological action situations) framework is to support a process of developing hypotheses about configurations of ASs that may explain an emergent social-ecological phenomenon. We suggest six social-ecological ASs along with social and ecological action situations that can commonly be found in natural resource or ecosystem management contexts. We test the ability of the framework to structure an analysis of processes of emergence by applying it to different case studies of regime shifts, traps, and sustainable resource use. The framework goes beyond existing frameworks and approaches, such as the SES framework or causal loop diagrams, by establishing a way of analyzing SES that focuses on the interplay of social-ecological interactions with the emergent outcomes they produce. We conclude by discussing the added value of the framework and discussing the different purposes it can serve: from supporting the development of theories of the emergence of social-ecological phenomena, enhancing transparency of SES understandings to serving as a boundary object for interdisciplinary knowledge integration.},

	abstract = {The combination of certain features of ﬁre disturbance, notably ﬁre frequency, size and severity, may be used to characterize the disturbance regime in any region of the boreal forest. As some consequences of ﬁre resemble the effects of industrial forest harvesting, conventional forest management is often considered as a disturbance that has effects similar to those of natural disturbances. Although the analogy between forest management and ﬁre disturbance in boreal ecosystems has some merit, it is important to recognise that it also has its limitations. Short ﬁre cycles generally described for boreal ecosystems do not appear to be universal; rather, important spatial and temporal variations have been observed in Canada. These variations in the ﬁre cycle have an important inﬂuence on forest composition and structure at the landscape and regional levels. Size and severity of ﬁres also show a large range of variability. In regions where the natural matrix of the boreal forest remains relatively intact, maintenance of this natural variability should be targeted by forest managers concerned with biodiversity conservation. Current forest management tends to reduce this variability: for example, fully regulated, even-aged management will tend to truncate the natural forest age distribution and eliminate over-mature and old-growth forests from the landscape. We suggest that the development of strategic-level forest management planning approaches and silvicultural techniques designed to maintain a spectrum of forest compositions and structures at different scales in the landscape is one avenue to maintain this variability. Although we use the boreal forest of Quebec for our examples, it is possible to apply the approach to those portions of the boreal forest where the ﬁre regime favours the development of even-aged stands in burns.},

The most common stability measures are asymptotic resilience, widely used in theoretical studies, and measures based on temporal variability, commonly used in empirical studies. We construct measures of invariability, deﬁned as the inverse of variability, that can be directly compared with asymptotic resilience. We show that asymptotic resilience behaves like the invariability of the most variable species, which is often a rare species close to its extinction boundary. Therefore, asymptotic resilience displays complete loss of stability with changes in community composition. In contrast, mean population invariability and ecosystem invariability are insensitive to rare species and quantify stability consistently whether details of species composition are considered or not. Invariability provides a consistent framework to predict diversitystability relationships that agree with empirical data at population and ecosystem levels.

Since antagonism is ubiquitous in natural and social networks, we clarify why this stringent hypothesis is necessary and what happens when it is relaxed.

	abstract = {Fire, ignited by lightning and Native Americans, was common in the Sierra Nevada prior to 20th century suppression efforts. Presettlement fire return intervals were generally less than 20 years throughout a broad zone extending from the foothills through the mixed conifer forests. In the 20th century, the areal extent of fire was greatty reduced. This reduction in fire activity, coupled with the selective harvest of many large pines, produced forests which today are denser, with generally smaller trees, and have higher proportions of white fir and incense cedar than were present historically. These changes have almost certainly increased the levels of fuel, both on the forest floor and “ladder fuels”-small trees and brush which carry the fire into the forest canopy. increases in fuel, coupled with efficient suppression of low and moderate intensity fires, has led to an increase in general fire severity.},

	abstract = {The synergism between climatic change and human action has provided conditions for the occurrence of forest ﬁres in the Amazon. We used annual mapping to reconstruct the history of ﬁre in Brazil’s state of Acre to understand the forest-ﬁre regime over a period of 33 years (1984–2016). The burn-scar index (BSI) derived from the fractions of soil and of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic material was generated by CLASlite© software using Landsat-TM and OLI satellite images. The area of forest-ﬁre scars totaled 525,130 ha in the period analyzed. This total includes forests that ﬁre aﬀected only once (388,350 ha), twice (59,800 ha) and three times (5727 ha). The years 2005 and 2010 represent 90\% of the total area of forest ﬁres in Acre, coinciding with severe droughts caused by the anomalous warming of the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. The most heavily impacted portion of Acre was in the eastern part of the state, which has the greatest forest fragmentation, consolidation of agricultural activity and presence of settlement projects. In 2005, the municipalities of Acrelândia, Plácido de Castro and Senador Guiomard accounted for more than 50\% of the forest remnants impacted by ﬁre. Of the total extent of forest ﬁres in Acre, 43\% occurred in settlement projects administered by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and 16\% in conservation units administered by the Ministry of Environment (MMA). The area of forest ﬁres was 36 times greater in the 16 years after 2000, compared to the 16 years before 2000. The frequency of ﬁres increased dramatically from one ﬁre episode roughly every ten years (period from 1984 to 2004), to one ﬁre every ﬁve years (period from 2005 to 2016). With the projections of warmer climate and advancing deforestation, the forest ﬁres in Acre will tend be more intense and frequent.},

	abstract = {Steep decline in forest fires about a century ago occurred in coniferous forests over large areas in North America and Fennoscandia. This poorly understood phenomenon has been explained by different factors in different regions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the validity of the four most commonly suggested causes of the decrease in forest fires: fire fighting, over-grazing, climate change and human influence. I compiled the available dendrochronological data and estimated the annually burned proportions of Pinus-dominated forests in four subcontinental regions during the past 500 years. These data were compared to the development of fire suppression, grazing pressure, climate and human livelihoods. The annually burned proportions declined over 90\% in all studied regions. In three out of the four regions fires decreased decades before fire suppression began. Available drought data are annually well correlated with fires but could not explain the decrease of the level in annually burned areas. A rapid increase in the number of livestock occurred at the same time with the decrease in fires in the Western US but not in Fennoscandia. Hence, fire suppression in Central Fennoscandia and over-grazing in the Western US may have locally contributed to the reduction of burned areas. More general explanation is offered by human influence hypothesis: the majority of the past forest fires were probably caused by humans and the decrease in the annually burned areas was because of a decrease in human caused fires. This is in accordance with the old written records and forest fire statistics. The decrease in annually burned areas, both in Fennoscandia and the United States coincides with an economic and cultural transition from traditional livelihoods that are associated with high fire use to modern agriculture and forestry.},

However, the role of phytoplankton functional diversity in ecosystem productivity and stability under ﬂuctuating (i.e. non-equilibrium) environments remains largely unknown. Here we use a marine ecosystem model to study the effect of phytoplankton functional diversity on both ecosystem productivity and its stability for seasonally variable nutrient supply and temperature. Functional diversity ranges from low to high along these two environmental axes independently. Changes in diversity are obtained by varying the range of uptake strategies and thermal preferences of the species present in the community. Species can range from resource gleaners to opportunists, and from cold to warm thermal preferences. The phytoplankton communities self-assemble as a result of species selection by resource competition (nutrients) and environmental ﬁltering (temperature). Both processes lead to species asynchrony but their effect on productivity and stability differ. We ﬁnd that the diversity of temperature niches has a strong and direct positive effect on productivity and stability due to species complementarity, while the diversity of uptake strategies has a weak and indirect positive effect due to sampling probability. These results show that more functionally diverse phytoplankton communities lead to higher and more stable ecosystem productivity but the positive effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning depends critically on the type of environmental gradient.},

Many international bodies, including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to stability that lack clear deﬁnition. Consequently, we cannot measure them and so they disconnect from a large body of theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the scientiﬁc and policy literature and show that this disconnect is one consequence of an inconsistent and one-dimensional approach that ecologists have taken to both disturbances and stability. This has led to confused communication of the nature of stability and the level of our insight into it. Disturbances and stability are multidimensional. Our understanding of them is not. We have a remarkably poor understanding of the impacts on stability of the characteristics that deﬁne many, perhaps all, of the most important elements of global change. We provide recommendations for theoreticians, empiricists and policymakers on how to better integrate the multidimensional nature of ecological stability into their research, policies and actions.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems constantly face disturbances which vary in their spatial and temporal features, yet little is known on how these features affect ecosystem recovery and persistence, i.e., ecosystem stability. We address this issue by considering three ecosystem models with different local dynamics, and ask how their stability properties depend on the spatial and temporal properties of disturbances. We measure the spatial dimension of disturbances by their spatial extent while controlling for their overall strength, and their temporal dimension by the average frequency of random disturbance events. Our models show that the return to equilibrium following a disturbance depends strongly on the disturbance’s extent, due to rescue effects mediated by dispersal. We then reveal a direct relation between the temporal variability caused by repeated disturbances and the recovery from an isolated disturbance event. Although this could suggest a trivial dependency of ecosystem response on disturbance frequency, we find that this is true only up to a frequency threshold, which depends on both the disturbance spatial features and the ecosystem dynamics. Beyond this threshold the response changes qualitatively, displaying spatial clusters of disturbed regions, causing an increase in variability, and even a system-wide collapse for ecosystems with alternative stable states. Thus, spanning the spatial dimension of disturbances is a way to probe the underlying dynamics of an ecosystem. Furthermore, considering spatial and temporal dimensions of disturbances in conjunction is necessary to predict ecosystem responses with dramatic ecological consequences, such as regime shifts or population extinction.},

	abstract = {Quantifying stability properties of ecosystems is an important problem in ecology. A common approach is based on the recovery from pulse perturbations, and posits that the faster an ecosystem return to its pre-perturbation state, the more stable it is. Theoretical studies often collapse the recovery dynamics into a single quantity: the long-term rate of return, called asymptotic resilience. However, empirical studies typically measure the recovery dynamics at much shorter time scales. In this paper we explain why asymptotic resilience is rarely representative of the short-term recovery. First, we show that, in contrast to asymptotic resilience, short-term return rates depend on features of the perturbation, in particular on the way its intensity is distributed over species. We argue that empirically relevant predictions can be obtained by considering the median response over a set of perturbations, for which we provide explicit formulas. Next, we show that the recovery dynamics are controlled through time by different species: abundant species tend to govern the short-term recovery, while rare species often dominate the longterm recovery. This shift from abundant to rare species typically causes short-term return rates to be unrelated to asymptotic resilience. We illustrate that asymptotic resilience can be determined by rare species that have almost no effect on the observable part of the recovery dynamics. Finally, we discuss how these ﬁndings can help to better connect empirical observations and theoretical predictions.},

	abstract = {In theoretical studies, the most commonly used measure of ecological stability is resilience: ecosystems asymptotic rate of return to equilibrium after a pulse-perturbation -or shock. A complementary notion of growing popularity is reactivity: the strongest initial response to shocks. On the other hand, empirical stability is often quantiﬁed as the inverse of temporal variability, directly estimated on data, and reﬂecting ecosystems response to persistent and erratic environmental disturbances. It is unclear whether and how this empirical measure is related to resilience and reactivity. Here, we establish a connection by introducing two variability-based stability measures belonging to the theoretical realm of resilience and reactivity. We call them intrinsic, stochastic and deterministic invariability; respectively deﬁned as the inverse of the strongest stationary response to white-noise and to single-frequency perturbations. We prove that they predict ecosystems worst response to broad classes of disturbances, including realistic models of environmental ﬂuctuations. We show that they are intermediate measures between resilience and reactivity and that, although deﬁned with respect to persistent perturbations, they can be related to the whole transient regime following a shock, making them more integrative notions than reactivity and resilience. We argue that invariability measures constitute a stepping stone, and discuss the challenges ahead to further unify theoretical and empirical approaches to stability.},

Here, we use a dynamical model of competitive metacommunities to study the relationships between species diversity and ecosystem variability across scales. We derive analytic relationships under a limiting case; these results are extended to more general cases with numerical simulations. Our model shows that, while alpha diversity decreases local ecosystem variability, beta diversity generally contributes to increasing spatial asynchrony among local ecosystems. Consequently, both alpha and beta diversity provide stabilising effects for regional ecosystems, through local and spatial insurance effects respectively. We further show that at the regional scale, the stabilising effect of biodiversity increases as spatial environmental correlation increases. Our ﬁndings have important implications for understanding the interactive effects of global environmental changes (e.g. environmental homogenisation) and biodiversity loss on ecosystem sustainability at large scales.},

However, when individuals choose habitats that maximize their performance instead of dispersing randomly, theory predicts dispersal with habitat choice to evolve in specialists, while generalists should disperse more randomly. We tested whether habitat choice is associated with thermal niche specialization using microcosms of the ciliate
              Tetrahymena thermophila
              , a species that performs active dispersal. We found that thermal specialists preferred optimal habitats as predicted by theory, a link that should make specialists more likely to track suitable conditions under environmental changes than expected under the random dispersal assumption. Surprisingly, generalists also performed habitat choice but with a preference for suboptimal habitats. Since this result challenges current theory, we developed a metapopulation model to understand under which circumstances such a preference for suboptimal habitats should evolve. We showed that competition between generalists and specialists may favor a preference for niche margins in generalists under environmental variability. Our results demonstrate that the behavioral dimension of dispersal—here, habitat choice—fundamentally alters our predictions of how dispersal evolve with niche specialization, making dispersal behaviors crucial for ecological forecasting facing environmental changes.},

            Understanding the consequences of habitat fragmentation to biological populations is crucial to develop sound conservation polices. The Straight-billed Reedhaunter (
            Limnoctites rectirostris
            ) is a little known and threatened Passeriform that is highly dependent Erygo wetlands patches. Here, we evaluated the effects of habitat fragmentation on populations of the Straight-billed Reedhaunter, during the construction of a water reservoir in southern Brazil. During eight months, we monitored five Eryngo wetlands patches occupied (n=3) and no occupied (n=2) by Straight-billed Reedhaunter individuals, collecting data on their temporal occupancy patterns and registering new fragmentation events in formally continuous habitat patches. We evaluated the consequences of habitat fragmentation on the probabilities of patch occupancy, colonization and extinction of populations of the Straight-billed Reedhaunter using an information-theoretic approach. Out of the three patches occupied by Straight-billed Reedhaunter, two were not altered by construction activities and their populations were present during the entire study period. After fragmentation events, local extinction in one of the wetland patches was observed, and individuals were sporadically observed in two other initially unoccupied sites. The model in which fragmentation affected only the extinction probability was the most plausible among the set of candidate models. Fragmentation greatly increased the chance of local population extinction within patches. Our results indicate that the conservation of populations of the Straight-billed Reedhaunter is highly dependent on continuous and unaltered wetland patches.},

	abstract = {The destruction of natural habitats for agricultural production results in local biodiversity loss. Biodiversity loss in turn aﬀects agricultural production indirectly through a range of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services. Land conversion thus results in a negative externality, mediated by changes in biodiversity. When the consequences of this externality are delayed in time, lack of internalization results in overshoot-and-collapse dynamics, which are undesirable from a sustainability perspective. Here, we emphasize the importance of forwardlooking policies for the long-term sustainability of human–nature interactions. We show that the internalization of this externality through a land tax can result in several win-win eﬀects in the long run. First, more biodiversity is preserved at equilibrium, which increases the carrying capacity and total well-being of the human population. Second, a taxation path that maximizes the discounted sum of human utilities prevents or greatly alleviates overshoot-and-collapse crises, thus increasing the sustainability of the system. In particular, this result holds in the case of imperfect information regarding the precise temporal dynamics of biodiversity loss, suggesting that the design of eﬃcient land-use management policies is possible despite incomplete ecological data. This study highlights the need to internalize biodiversity-dependent externalities through economic incentives, especially under uncertainty regarding long-term ecological dynamics.},

Traditionally, the robustness of ecological networks has been evaluated based on simulation studies where primary extinctions occur at random or as a function of species specialization, ignoring other important biological factors. Here, we estimate the robustness of a seed dispersal network from a grassland–forest mosaic in southern Brazil, simulating distinct scenarios of woody plant species extinction, including scenarios where species are eliminated based on their evolutionary and functional distinctiveness. Our results suggest that the network is more robust when species are eliminated based on their evolutionary uniqueness, followed by random extinctions, the extinction of the most specialist species, functional distinctiveness and, at last, when the most generalist species are sequentially eliminated. Our results provide important information for grassland–forest mosaic management, as they indicate that loss of generalist species and functional diversity makes the system more likely to collapse.},

These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples.

To aid policy decisions, these indicators are therefore either presented in the context of a conceptual framework, or quantitatively aggregated into indices. Due to the quantitative nature of sustainability indices, their results may be given more weight by scientists and policy-makers. However, policy decisions can be ineffective or even counterproductive if they do not consider factors which influence index behavior: the scale of the available data and choice of system boundaries; the inclusion, transformation, and weighting of indicator data; and the aggregation method used. As previous reviews have demonstrated, sustainability indices do not rank countries consistently, even when using some of the same indicator data. Several improvements would increase the utility of sustainability indices for policy decisions, particularly the identification of biases introduced by the index methodology and data inclusion. The discrepancy of current sustainability indices due to theoretical or methodological differences supports the use of several complementary indices.},

Using case studies and the literature, we trace the evolution of systems thinking and demonstrate how systems mapping could support the process of planning and evaluating interventions.

It can also change the way interventions are characterized and communicated by emphasizing the systems targeted for change as opposed to actions.

Such behavior can be predicted if one knows the stable and unstable equilibrium states in a system and how these equilibria react to changes in the system stressors. The state of the system rapidly or gradually changes either toward (i.e., stable equilibrium) or away from (i.e., unstable equilibrium) an equilibrium. However, the equilibrium states in a SES are often unknown and difficult to identify in real systems. In contrast, agent-based SES models can potentially be used to determine equilibria states, but are rarely used for this purpose. We developed a generic approach to identify stable and unstable equilibria states with agent-based SES models. We used an agent-based SES model to simulate land-use change in an alpine mountain region in the Canton of Valais, Switzerland. By iteratively running this model for different input settings, we were able to identify equilibria in intensive and extensive agriculture. We also assessed the sensitivity of these equilibria to changes in external system stressors. With support-vector machine classifications, we created bifurcation diagrams in which the stable and unstable equilibria as a function of the values of a system stressor were depicted. The external stressors had a strong influence on the equilibrium states. We also found that a minimum amount of direct payments was necessary for agricultural extensification to take place. Our approach does not only provide valuable insights into the resilience of our case-study region to changing conditions, but can also be applied to other (agent-based) SES models to present important model results in a condensed and understandable format.},

These principles can help identify appropriate methods and approaches for studying SES. We discuss three main implications of studying and engaging with SES as CAS. First, there needs to be a shift in focus when studying the dynamics and interactions in SES, to better capture the nature of the organizing principles that characterize SES behavior. Second, realizing that the nature of the intertwined social-ecological relations is complex has real consequences for how we choose methods and practical approaches for observing and studying SES interactions.

We distinguish two types of responses: one that enables the system to absorb disturbances from an existing disturbance regime, and one that enables a system to reconstruct itself after a fundamental change in a disturbance regime. We use immune systems as a model for how systems can deal with disturbances, and use this model to derive insights in adaptive capacity of social-ecological systems. We identify a tension between the two types of responses where one beneﬁts from learning and memory while the other requires fast-turnover of experience. We discuss how this may affect building up adaptive capacity of social-ecological systems.},

	abstract = {Robustness and resilience are concepts in systems thinking that have grown in importance and popularity. For many complex social-ecological systems, however, robustness and resilience are difficult to quantify and the connections and trade-offs between them difficult to study. Most studies have either focused on qualitative approaches 10 to discuss their connections or considered only one of them under particular classes of disturbances. In this study, we present an analytical framework to address the linkage between robustness and resilience more systematically. Our analysis is based on a stylized dynamical model that operationalizes a widely used conceptual framework for socialecological systems. The model enables us to rigorously delineate the boundaries of conditions under which the coupled system can be sustained in a long run, define robustness and resilience related to these boundaries, and consequently 15 investigate their connections. The results reveal the tradeoffs between robustness and resilience. They also show how the nature of such tradeoffs varies with the choices of certain policies (e.g., taxation and investment in public infrastructure), internal stresses and external disturbances.},

	abstract = {Regime shifts, i.e., large, persistent, and usually unexpected changes in ecosystems and social-ecological systems, can have major impacts on ecosystem services, and consequently, on human well-being. However, the vulnerability of different regions to various regime shifts is largely unknown because evidence for the existence of regime shifts in different ecosystems and parts of the world is scattered and highly uneven. Furthermore, research tends to focus on individual regime shifts rather than comparisons across regime shifts, limiting the potential for identifying common drivers that could reduce the risk of multiple regime shifts simultaneously. Here, we introduce the Regime Shifts Database, an open-access database that systematically synthesizes information on social-ecological regime shifts across a wide range of systems using a consistent, comparative framework, providing a wide-ranging information resource for environmental planning, assessment, research, and teaching initiatives. The database currently contains 28 generic types of regime shifts and {\textgreater} 300 specific case studies. Each entry provides a literature-based synthesis of the key drivers and feedbacks underlying the regime shift, as well as impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being, and possible management options. Across the 28 regime shifts, climate change and agriculture-related activities are the most prominent among a wide range of drivers. Biodiversity, fisheries, and aquatic ecosystems are particularly widely affected, as are key aspects of human well-being, including livelihoods, food and nutrition, and an array of cultural ecosystem services. We hope that the database will stimulate further research and teaching on regime shifts that can inform policy and practice and ultimately enhance our collective ability to manage and govern large, abrupt, systemic changes in the Anthropocene.},

The last decade has seen regional and global communities transition through unprecedented economic change. Community resilience offers a framework to guide regional development and explore the sustainability of social, economic and environmental systems to manage change. However, the fundamental constructs of community resilience are still not well known, such as the critical role of emotional stability and residents’ perceptions of change. This research explores this relationship in economies undergoing transformations by presenting the results of a survey administered to 663 Mackay and Whitsunday residents in Queensland, Australia. The ﬁndings add substantial depth to community resilience theory by demonstrating a positive relationship between emotional stability and resilience and a negative relationship between resilience and perceptions of change. The results also provide insight into the sustainable characteristics of communities to build resilience and manage the transformation process. Future research should focus on further testing the relationship between resilience, emotional stability and perceptions of change within communities at different stages of the transformation process.},

A growth-oriented assessment was carried out in parallel to provide a reference for interpreting the results. A set of criteria corresponding with each of the two assessment approaches was applied to obtain quantitative results. To determine the spatial dependency of the values’ characteristics, spatial statistics was applied. The reinterpretation of existing data and comparison of the results revealed a new level of insight into regional development and made it possible to determine the level of resilience of a region or municipality. The resilience could be evaluated relatively, by comparing the resilience of different spatial units within the study area. Similarities and differences between the results of the two approaches were revealed and discussed. The outcomes confirmed that the growth-oriented perspective is too narrow and further approaches are necessary in order to assess the sustainability and resilience of the local and regional spatial structures and development.},

First, an overview of resilience deﬁnitions used across various scientiﬁc disciplines is presented, followed by an in-depth analysis of resilience assessment and quantiﬁcation for energy systems. The relevant literature is classiﬁed by approach and according to four key functions of resilience: resist, restabilize, rebuild, and reconﬁgure.

	abstract = {Background:  The term resilience describes stress–response patterns of subjects across scientific disciplines. In ecol‑ogy, advances have been made to clearly distinguish resilience definitions based on underlying mechanistic assump‑tions. Engineering resilience (rebound) is used for describing the ability of subjects to recover from adverse conditions (disturbances), and is the rate of recovery. In contrast, the ecological resilience definition considers a systemic change: when complex systems (including humans) respond to disturbances by reorganizing into a new regime (stable state) where structural and functional aspects have fundamentally changed relative to the prior regime. In this context, resilience is an emergent property of complex systems. We argue that both resilience definitions and uses are appro‑priate in psychology and psychiatry, but although the differences are subtle, the implications and uses are profoundly different.
Methods:  We borrow from the field of ecology to discuss resilience concepts in the mental health sciences.
Results:  In psychology and psychiatry, the prevailing view of resilience is adaptation to, coping with, and recovery (engineering resilience) from adverse social and environmental conditions. Ecological resilience may be useful for describing vulnerability, onset, and the irreversibility patterns of mental disorders. We discuss this in the context of bipolar disorder.
Conclusion:  Rebound, adaptation, and coping are processes that are subsumed within the broader systemic organization of humans, from which ecological resilience emanates. Discerning resilience concepts in psychology and psychiatry has potential for a mechanistically appropriate contextualization of mental disorders at large. This might contribute to a refinement of theory and contextualize clinical practice within the broader systemic functioning of mental illnesses.},

	abstract = {1) Background: Bipolar or manic-depressive disorder is a malign mental disease that frequently faces social stigma. Educational and thinking models are needed to increase people\&rsquo;s awareness and understanding of the disorder. The arts have potential to achieve this goal. 2) Methods: This paper builds on the recent use of heavy metal music as a thinking and education model. It emphasizes the artistic component of heavy metal and its potential to characterize the symptomatology during the episodes of (hypo)mania and depression and the recurrence of these episodes. Heavy metal music has diversified into subgenres that become allegorical to both the symptoms of episodes and the recurrence of bipolar cycles. 3) Results: Examples of songs are given that mirror distinct facets of the disorder. 4) Conclusion: Although the links drawn between art (music) and science (psychiatry) are inherently subjective, such connections might be used to trigger a learning process, facilitate judgment and decision-making, and induce affective reactions and memory formation in the listener. The approach may facilitate collaborative efforts and serve healthcare professionals and educators as a communication tool to aid the public\&rsquo;s comprehension of the disease and an associated social paradox: On one hand, bipolar disorder incurs substantial costs to society. On the other hand, it benefits from the creative artistic and scientific endeavors of bipolar individuals from which cultural and political gains may ensue.},

We converted 71-year time series of inundation area and rainfall data from the freshwater marsh Las Tablas de Daimiel into a soprano and bass voice, respectively. We composed “The Lament of Las Tablas de Daimiel,” which sings the biophysical disruption of the wetland due to the agricultural transformation. More generally, the song testifies to the demise of the natural aquatic environment due to unsustainable use of limited water resources in dryland countries and elsewhere. Making the mute voices of ecosystem heard may have potential to increase awareness about the unsustainable use of short water supplies and other social-ecological challenges. In the age of big data in science, data sonification may be a useful tool to represent and communicate such challenges.},

In the second part of the paper, we argue that (1) for systems of interest (primarily social systems or system with a social component) we seem to have options with respect to how they are described and (2) that this matters for what is to be taken as a sign of resilience as opposed to a sign of the lack of resilience for such systems. We discuss the implications of this for how the concept should be applied in practice and suggest that users of the resilience concept face a choice between versions of the concept that are either ontologically or normatively charged.},

	abstract = {The concept of resilience, and livelihood resilience more speciﬁcally, is growing in prominence with international development and humanitarian organizations that aim to measure and build resilience to speciﬁc disturbances such as ﬂoods or droughts. However, measuring livelihood resilience is a difﬁcult task, and practical methods to measure livelihood resilience, as well as analyze and visualize the data are needed. In this paper, I introduce the Household Livelihood Resilience Approach (HLRA), which draws from the sustainable livelihoods approach and it’s ﬁve capital assets to measure resilience. However, unlike other approaches that use the ﬁve capital assets such as utilized by Zurich Insurance Group, Ltd and the IFRC, the HLRA goes farther to help visualize the results and identify speciﬁc actions to build resilience. This paper illustrates the effectiveness of the HLRA through an empirical case study where this approach was used to measure livelihood resilience in Isiolo County, Kenya, and the effectiveness of agroforestry in building livelihood resilience for agricultural households. Drawing from this case study, I suggest ﬁve ways that the HLRA improves upon previous frameworks, including 1) providing practical methods and tools, not just a theoretical framework, 2) integrating ‘subjective’ measures of livelihood resilience, 3) focusing on the household-scale instead of community-scale or larger, 4) providing methods to analyze, visualize, and interpret results of livelihood resilience measures, and 5) highlighting the importance of human agency, power, and access to assets. The HLRA has the potential to help organizations identify speciﬁc interventions that could help build livelihood resilience for the most vulnerable groups of people within a community.},

This paper analyzes socioenvironmental change processes in a dynamic peri-urban context in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, and argues that unequal power relations between diverse actors and their diﬀering interests refute notions of “collective action” and “community resilience.” Residents of peri-urban communities are diverse, have varying abilities and interests, and use diﬀerent strategies and actions in response to complex socio-environmental changes. These diﬀerences reduce insecurities for some while reproducing inequalities for others. These interrelations at the local level are driven by wider socio-economic, political, and institutional processes that transcend community boundaries, interests, and beneﬁts. In the face of these complexities, “community resilience” is an unviable, externally deﬁned, and engineered goal, often at odds with the power discrepancies and heterogeneity found within actual communities. These ﬁndings suggest a need to pay attention to the social, economic, and political dynamics of socioenvironmental changes that simultaneously shape local communities and their members’ abilities to respond to changes at various scales.},

Its Latin origin, resilire, means “bouncing back”—should bouncing back be understood literally or rather metaphorically in the context of health, illness, dis‐ease, and disease? This essay examines ecological, physiological, personal, and health system perspectives inherent in the concept of resilience. It emerges that regardless of the level of aggregation, resilience is a systems property—it is as much a property of each of the subsystems of network physiology, the person, and the health care delivery system as it is a property of the health system as a whole. Given the interdependencies between people, their internal and external environments, and the health service system, strengthening resilience, ie, the ability to positively adapt to challenges and changing circumstances, will require a broad‐based public discourse: “How can we strengthen resilience and health for the benefit of people and society at large”.},

However, operationalizing resilience of such functions is challenging, because conceptual approaches differ, direct measures are difficult, and the validity and interpretation of existing indicators are unclear. Here, we (1) summarize dimensions of resilience that apply in agroecosystems, and the disturbances they are subject to under EC. We then (2) review indicators of the resilience of biodiversity-driven functions in agroecosystems, and their support in theoretical and empirical studies. (3) Using these indicators, we examine what can be learned for the resilience of these functions to drivers of EC, focussing on the ecosystem services of biological pest control, biological disease control in soil and pollination. We conclude (4) that research into the resilience of these services is still in its infancy, but novel tools and approaches can catalyse further steps to assess and improve the resilience of biodiversity-driven agroecosystem functions under EC.},

We review multivariate early warning and regime shift detection metrics, identify situations where various metrics will be most useful for rangeland science, and then highlight known shortcomings. Our review of a suite of multivariate-based regime shift/early warning indicators provides a broad range of metrics applicable to a wide variety of data types or contexts, from situations where a great deal is known about the key system drivers and a regime shift is hypothesized a priori, to situations where the key drivers and the possibility of a regime shift are both unknown. These metrics can be used to answer ecological state-and-transition questions, inform policymakers, and provide quantitative decision-making tools for managers.},

After analyzing the conceptual structure of the resilience paradigm and of GST, we identify concepts in resilience thinking where GST provides new confirmation or modifies the perspective: complexity, evolution, self‐organization, and adaptation. We discuss postBertalanffy developments in the interdisciplinary and twinned fields of systems theory and complexity studies that can provide bridging concepts between GST and resilience thinking. In conclusion, we emphasize the need for both cognitive and institutional resilience to foster adaptive governance. We highlight the management of couplings between systems and the switching between forms of understanding and forms of organization, where self‐organization and more centralized forms of steering can alternate and combine.},

	abstract = {The direct measurement of the resilience (resistance to disturbances) of an ecosystem’s current regime (or “alternative stable state”) remains a key concern for managing human impacts on these ecosystems and their risk of collapse. Approaches which utilize statistics or information theory have demonstrated utility in identifying regime boundaries. Here, we use Fisher information to establish the limits of the resilience of a dynamic regime of a predator–prey system. This is important because previous studies using Fisher information focused on detecting whether a regime change has occurred, whereas here we are interested in determining how much an ecological system can vary its properties without a regime change occurring. We illustrate the theory with simple two species systems. We apply it first to a predator–prey model and then to a 60-year wolf–moose population dataset from Isle Royale National Park in Michigan, USA. We assess the resilience boundaries and the operating range of a system’s parameters without a regime change from entirely new criteria for Fisher information, oriented toward regime stability. The approach allows us to use system measurements to determine the shape and depth of the “cup” as defined by the broader resilience concept.},

	abstract = {This paper builds a bridge between heavy metal music, complexity theory and sustainability science to show the potential of the (auditory) arts to inform different aspects of complex systems of people and nature. The links are described along different dimensions. This first dimension focuses on the scientific aspect of heavy metal. It uses complex adaptive systems theory to show that the rapid diversification and evolution of heavy metal into multiple subgenres leads to a self-organizing and resilient socio-musicological system. The second dimension builds on the recent use of heavy metal as a critical thinking model and educational tool, emphasizing the artistic component of heavy metal and its potential to increase people’s awareness of environmental sustainability challenges. The relationships between metal, complexity theory and sustainability are first discussed independently to specifically show mechanistic links and the reciprocal potential to inform one domain (science) by the other (metal) within these dimensions. The paper concludes by highlighting that these dimensions entrain each other within a broader socialcultural-environmental system that cannot be explained simply by the sum of independent, individual dimensions. Such a unified view embraces the inherent complexity with which systems of people and nature interact. These lines of exploration suggest that the arts and the sciences form a logical partnership. Such a partnership might help in endeavors to envision, understand and cope with the broad ramifications of sustainability challenges in times of rapid social, cultural, and environmental change.},

Moving away from the reductionist frameworks and the complicated domain predominated by known unknowns and order, a call is being made to the social sciences to begin adopting complexity theory and newer connectionist methods that better address complexity and open social systems. Scholars and scholar-practitioners will continue to find the need to apply complexity theory as wicked problems become more prevalent in the social sciences. This paper differentiates between general systems theory (GST) and complexity theory, as well as identifies advantages for the social sciences in incorporating complexity theory as a formal theory. Complexity theory is expanded upon and identified as providing a new perspective and a new method of theorizing that can be practiced by disciplines within the social sciences. These additions could better position the social sciences to address the complexity associated with advancing technology, globalization, intricate markets, cultural change, and the myriad of challenges and opportunities to come.},

Wuwei is a way of governing and leadership, while self-organization is the emergence of new structures at the global level as a result of local interactions. The combination of topdown and bottom-up processes contributes to create a dynamic classroom. The contemporary Neo-Daoists’ concerns with creating conditions for wuwei to happen can be addressed by principles of self-organization, while wuwei provides a philosophical underpinning that is informative to systems theories. This article first introduces the Daoist notion of wuwei, then articulate important principles of self-organization theory, and further juxtapose the two in both resonance and dissonance in four aspects: the role of change, the role of diversity, the role of the individual person, and the role of the teacher’s wuwei leadership in the selforganizing classroom. In the last section, the article discusses how to shift classroom dynamics toward emergent, relational, and creative pathways, including creating conditions for self-organization and wuwei to happen in the classroom.},

	abstract = {Several frameworks have been developed to assess the resilience of social-ecological systems, but most require substantial data inputs, time, and technical expertise. Stakeholders and practitioners often lack the resources for such intensive efforts. Furthermore, most end with problem framing and fail to explicitly address trade-offs and uncertainty. To remedy this gap, we developed a rapid survey assessment that compares the relative resilience of social-ecological systems with respect to a number of resilience properties. This approach generates large amounts of information relative to stakeholder inputs. We targeted four stakeholder categories: government (policy, regulation, management), end users (farmers, ranchers, landowners, industry), agency/public science (research, university, extension), and NGOs (environmental, citizen, social justice) in four North American watersheds, to assess social-ecological resilience through surveys. Conceptually, social-ecological systems are comprised of components ranging from strictly human to strictly ecological, but that relate directly or indirectly to one another. They have soft boundaries and several important dimensions or axes that together describe the nature of social-ecological interactions, e.g., variability, diversity, modularity, slow variables, feedbacks, capital, innovation, redundancy, and ecosystem services. There is no absolute measure of resilience, so our design takes advantage of cross-watershed comparisons and therefore focuses on relative resilience. Our approach quantifies and compares the relative resilience across watershed systems and potential trade-offs among different aspects of the social-ecological system, e.g., between social, economic, and ecological contributions. This approach permits explicit assessment of several types of uncertainty (e.g., self-assigned uncertainty for stakeholders; uncertainty across respondents, watersheds, and subsystems), and subjectivity in perceptions of resilience among key actors and decision makers and provides an efficient way to develop the mental models that inform our stakeholders and stakeholder categories.},

To test the proposed framework, a multilayer collaboration network of 35 organizations from five infrastructure sectors in Harris County, Texas, was mapped based on a survey of Hurricane Harvey. The analysis results showed that before Hurricane Harvey, coordination among flood control, transportation, and infrastructure development sectors lacked essential integration to foster robust resilience plans.

Either reduced resilience or increased external ﬂuctuations can tip ecosystems to an alternative stable state. It is shown that changes in asymmetry in the distribution of time series data, quantiﬁed by changing skewness, is a model-independent and reliable early warning signal for both routes to regime shifts. Furthermore, using model simulations that mimic ﬁeld measurements and a simple analysis of real data from abrupt climate change in the Sahara, we study the feasibility of skewness calculations using data available from routine monitoring.},

The stationarity conditions and autocorrelation function are derived. The estimation is easily done via a simple EM algorithm and the model selection problem is addressed. The shape changing feature of the conditional distributions makes these models capable of modelling time series with multimodal conditional distributions and with heteroscedasticity.

In ice-core proxy records of Greenland paleotemperature, a reduction in the number of climate states from two to one is detected sometime prior to the last glacial maximum (LGM), 23–19 kyr BP. This result is also found in analysis of Greenland Ca data. The bifurcation can be interpreted as loss of stability of the warm interstadial state of the DansgaardOeschger (DO) events.

It is known, however, that even mild environmental noise may induce large ﬂuctuations in population abundances. This is due to a resonance effect that occurs in communities on the edge of stability. Here, we use a simple predator-prey model to explore the sensitivity of plankton communities to stochastic environmental ﬂuctuations. Our results show that the magnitude of resonance depends on the timescale of intrinsic population dynamics relative to the characteristic timescale of the environmental ﬂuctuations. Predator-prey communities with an intrinsic tendency to oscillate at a period T are particularly responsive to red noise characterized by a timescale of t p T/2p. We compare these theoretical predictions with the timescales of temperature ﬂuctuations measured in lakes and oceans. This reveals that plankton communities will be highly sensitive to natural temperature ﬂuctuations. More speciﬁcally, we demonstrate that the relatively fast temperature ﬂuctuations in shallow lakes fall largely within the range to which rotifers and cladocerans are most sensitive, while marine copepods and krill will tend to resonate more strongly with the slower temperature variability of the open ocean.},

A key component of this ‘‘Green Revolution’’ has been application of inorganic fertilizers to produce and maintain high crop yields. However, the long-term sustainability of these practices is unclear given the eutrophying effects of fertilizer runoff as well as the reliance of fertilizer production on finite non-renewable resources such as mined phosphate- and potassiumbearing rocks. Indeed, recent volatility in food and agricultural commodity prices, especially phosphate fertilizer, has raised concerns about emerging constraints on fertilizer production with consequences for its affordability in the developing world. We examined 30 years of monthly prices of fertilizer commodities (phosphate rock, urea, and potassium) for comparison with three food commodities (maize, wheat, and rice) and three non-agricultural commodities (gold, nickel, and petroleum). Here we show that all commodity prices, except gold, had significant change points between 2007–2009, but the fertilizer commodities, and especially phosphate rock, showed multiple symptoms of nonlinear critical transitions. In contrast to fertilizers and to rice, maize and wheat prices did not show significant signs of nonlinear dynamics. From these results we infer a recent emergence of a scarcity price in global fertilizer markets, a result signaling a new high price regime for these essential agricultural inputs. Such a regime will challenge on-going efforts to establish global food security but may also prompt fertilizer use practices and nutrient recovery strategies that reduce eutrophication.},

This is a paradox since the changing nature of banking risks as more economies liberalise and develop their ﬁnancial systems, as well as ongoing innovation, makes the use of EWS for informing policies aimed at preventing crises more necessary than ever. In this context, we assess the logit and signal extraction EWS for banking crises on a comprehensive common dataset. We suggest that logit is the most appropriate approach for global EWS and signal extraction for country-speciﬁc EWS. Furthermore, it is important to consider the policy maker’s objectives when designing predictive models and setting related thresholds since there is a sharp trade-off between correctly calling crises and false alarms.},

So far, the majority of such warning signals documented have been in highly controlled laboratory systems or in theoretical models. Data from wild populations, however, are typically restricted both temporally and spatially due to limited monitoring resources and intrinsic ecological heterogeneity—limitations that may affect the detectability of generic early warning signals, as they add additional stochasticity to population abundance estimates. Consequently, spatial and temporal subsampling may serve to either mufﬂe or magnify early warning signals. Using a combination of theoretical models and analysis of experimental data, we evaluate the extent to which statistical warning signs are robust to data corruption.},

	abstract = {Increasingly studies are reporting sudden and dramatic changes in the structure and function of communities or ecosystems. The prevalence of these reports demonstrates the importance for management of being able to detect whether these have happened and, preferably, whether they are likely to occur. Ecological theory provides the rationale for why such changes occur and a variety of statistical indicators of approach that have generic properties have been developed. However, whether the theory has successfully translated into monitoring programmes is unknown. We searched the literature for guidelines that would drive design of monitoring programmes able to detect past and approaching tipping points and analysed marine monitoring programmes in New Zealand. We found very few guidelines in the ecological, environmental or monitoring literature, although both simulation and marine empirical studies suggest that within-year sampling increases the likelihood of detecting approaching tipping points. The combination of the need to monitor both small and medium scale temporal dynamics of multiple variables to detect tipping points meant that few marine monitoring programmes in New Zealand were ﬁt for that purpose. Interestingly, we found many marine examples of studies detecting past and approaching TP with fewer data than was common in the theoretical literature. We, therefore, suggest that utilizing ecological knowledge is of paramount importance in designing and analyzing time-series monitoring for tipping points and increasing the certainty for short-term or infrequent datasets of whether a tipping point has occurred. As monitoring plays an important role in management of tipping points by providing supporting information for other locations about when and why a tipping point may occur, we believe that monitoring for tipping points should be promoted.},

Recent research has documented cases of regime shifts in local and regional systems and there is mounting concern about regime shifts of global signiﬁcance. In this paper we discuss management of social–ecological systems in light of the potential for regime shift. Management that increases system resilience and lowers the probability of regime shifts is beneﬁcial when regime shifts are likely to reduce human well-being. It may not always be possible to avoid harmful regime shifts, so building capacity to adapt should a regime shift occur is beneﬁcial too. Adaptive management can help reduce uncertainty about the likelihood of regime shifts, how this likelihood can be affected by management action, and the impact of regime shifts on well-being. Linking scientiﬁc understanding with decision-making is important but distributional consequences can impede decision making and action.},

	abstract = {In this paper we examine the management of a natural resource, a ﬁshery, subject to regime shifting dynamics. A regime shift is deﬁned as an episode in which the dynamics of the resource can switch between two alternative regimes at random times. Speciﬁcally, we study the impact of reversible regime switching, both observed and unobserved, on optimal harvesting policy. The case in which the regime is not directly observed, i.e., observational uncertainty, is addressed by using the extended POMDP approach developed in Fackler and Paciﬁci (2014). We illustrate the performance of the model under different assumptions on the underlying stochastic growth variability, the biological structure of the stock in different regimes, and the resilience of the regimes. When the regime is known optimal policies depend on the population level and which regime is currently active. When the regime is unobserved, on the other hand, the optimal policy depends on the population level and a belief distribution about the current regime. In general when the probability of regime change is ﬁxed, and hence is not affected by harvesting policy, the optimal policy is of the constant-escapement variety. When the probability of switching regime is endogenous the optimal policy is no longer of the constant-escapement type. Optimal policies when the regime is uncertain are approximately equal to a weighted average of the policies when the regime is certain, with the weights equal to the beliefs in the associated regimes, but there are differences.},

	title = {Fire, climate change, and forest resilience in interior {Alaska}},
	abstract = {In the boreal forests of interior Alaska, feedbacks that link forest soils, fire characteristics, and plant traits have supported stable cycles of forest succession for the past 6000 years. This high resilience of forest stands to fire disturbance is supported by two interrelated feedback cycles: (i) interactions among disturbance regime and plant-soil-microbial feedbacks that regulate soil organic layer thickness and the cycling of energy and materials, and (ii) interactions among soil conditions, plant regeneration traits, and plant effects on the environment that maintain stable cycles of forest community composition. Unusual fire events can disrupt these cycles and trigger a regime shift of forest stands from one stability domain to another (e.g., from conifer to deciduous forest dominance). This may lead to abrupt shifts in forest cover in response to changing climate and fire regime, particularly at sites with intermediate levels of moisture availability where stand-scale feedback cycles are only weakly constrained by environmental conditions. However, the loss of resilience in individual stands may foster resilience at the landscape scale, if changes in the landscape configuration of forest cover types feedback to stabilize regional patterns of fire behavior and climate conditions.},

Because of their important ecological and economic consequences, recent research has focused on devising early warning signals for anticipating such abrupt ecological transitions. In particular, theoretical studies show that changes in spatial characteristics of the system could provide early warnings of approaching transitions. However, the empirical validation of these indicators lag behind their theoretical developments. Here, we summarize a range of currently available spatial early warning signals, suggest potential null models to interpret their trends, and apply them to three simulated spatial data sets of systems undergoing an abrupt transition. In addition to providing a step-by-step methodology for applying these signals to spatial data sets, we propose a statistical toolbox that may be used to help detect approaching transitions in a wide range of spatial data. We hope that our methodology together with the computer codes will stimulate the application and testing of spatial early warning signals on real spatial data.},

Instead of an equilibrium point, the equilibrial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution, which is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using ﬁrst-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain conﬁdence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous ﬁsh abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.},

Potential leading indicators include wider swings in dynamics of key ecosystem variables, slower return rates after perturbation and shift of variance towards lower frequencies. We evaluated these indicators using a food web model calibrated to long-term whole-lake experiments. We investigated whether impending regime shifts driven by gradual increase in exploitation of the top predator can create signals that cascade through food webs and be discerned in phytoplankton. Substantial changes in standard deviations, return rates and spectra occurred near the switch point, even two trophic levels removed from the regime shift in ﬁshes. Signals of regime shift can be detected well in advance, if the driver of the regime shift changes much more slowly than the dynamics of key ecosystem variables which can be sampled frequently enough to measure the indicators. However, the regime shift may occur long after the driver has passed the critical point, because of very slow transient dynamics near the critical point. Thus, the ecosystem can be poised for regime shift by the time the signal is discernible. Field tests are needed to evaluate these indicators.},

	abstract = {One of the longest marine monitoring programs in the North Sea has been the spatiotemporal surveying of subsurface plankton since 1931. During this period a regime shift was detected in the late 1980s culminating in marked changes in phytoplankton, zooplankton and in the ﬁsheries of horse mackerel. Here we used the phytoplankton colour index, a visual biomass estimate, from 1948 to 2010 and total diatom abundance from 1958 to 2010 to test whether the well-documented regime shift could have been anticipated by the recently developed Early-Warning Signals for critical transitions (EWS). We estimated EWS, namely autocorrelation and standard deviation, within moving windows along the time series prior to the regime shift. We found that both statistics increased revealing that the North Sea ecosystem was becoming progressively unstable prior to the regime shift. Moreover, this high-resolution time series permitted us to test for robustness, error and signiﬁcance of the EWS. We did that by dividing the time series into independent blocks and estimating EWS after bootstrapping and randomising the blocks. This alternative approach conﬁrmed the robustness of the EWS with limited associated errors. In particular, we found that the warning was signiﬁcantly evident years before the onset of the regime shift. We conclude that EWS may provide robust and timely warning for upcoming regime shifts depending on the quality and quantity of recorded data in marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Catastrophic and sudden collapses of ecosystems are sometimes preceded by early warning signals that potentially could be used to predict and prevent a forthcoming catastrophe. Universality of these early warning signals has been proposed, but no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that in relatively simple ecological models the most commonly used early warning signals for a catastrophic collapse can be silent. We underpin the mathematical reason for this phenomenon, which involves the direction of the eigenvectors of the system. Our results demonstrate that claims on the universality of early warning signals are not correct, and that catastrophic collapses can occur without prior warning. In order to correctly predict a collapse and determine whether early warning signals precede the collapse, detailed knowledge of the mathematical structure of the approaching bifurcation is necessary. Unfortunately, such knowledge is often only obtained after the collapse has already occurred.},

	abstract = {Several episodes of sudden large scale disruptions in electrical service deeply impacted both the social stability and economic development in affected countries. The prevention of such catastrophic incidents poses huge challenges for reliability study and operational practices in power systems. Studies in other scientiﬁc ﬁelds show that, upon reaching a tipping point, complex dynamical systems can experience sudden transitions into a contrasting state. These transitions may be predicted through behavioral changes in some statistical measures of the system state. Inspired by these studies, this paper proposes an analysis of the critical transition in power systems from a long-term perspective. The evolution of the operational “stress” and its cyclical variation due to a slowly increasing demand and system expansions is simulated on a test system. The disturbances and the resulting failures under different stress levels are studied. Our analysis identiﬁes the statistical trends known as ﬂickering and critical slowing down in the operational and the recorded outage data along the simulation. These statistical changes can be used as early warning signals of the upcoming operational state which is more prone to a catastrophic blackout. The development of such early warning signals is the key to reaching higher levels of reliability in the energy supply infrastructure that society requires today.},

Other complex biological systems show that increased variance and autocorrelations in time series may act as valid early warning signals for critical transitions. On population level, we determined the likelihood that increased variance and autocorrelation of hospital visit on cardiopulmonary disease preceded critical transitions in population health by human-pollution interactions. We investigated long-term hospital visits from a hospital in Nanjing City, China during 2006–2016 for the most important cardiopulmonary diseases likely to be inﬂuenced by air pollution: cerebrovascular accident disease (CVAD), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer disease (LCD), and the grouped categories of respiratory system disease (RESD) and cardio-cerebrovascular system disease (CCD). The time series of standard deviations (SDs) and autocorrelation at-lag-1 (AR1) were studied as potential Early-Warning Indicators (EWIs) of transitions in population health. Elevated SDs provided an early warning for critical transitions in visit for LCD and overall CCD and CVAD, for the period of 2012–2013, after which a real transition of increased visit occurred for these disease categories. Statistical testing showed that these SDs were signiﬁcantly increased (p {\textless} 0.1). The long-term air pollution together with intermittent pollution episodes may have triggered critical transitions in population health for cardiopulmonary disease. It is recommended to consider signiﬁcant increases in variability in time series of relevant system parameters, such as visit, as early warning signs for future transitions in populations' health states.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem dynamics can exhibit large, nonlinear changes after small changes in an environmental parameter that passes a critical threshold. These regime shifts are often associated with loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Because critical thresholds for regime shifts are hard to determine with precision, some recent studies have focused on deriving signals from dynamics leading up to the thresholds. Models in these studies depend on using noise terms independent of system parameters and variables to add stochasticity. However, demographic stochasticity, an important source of random variability, arises directly from system dynamics. In this study, a framework is developed for modeling demographic stochasticity in a mechanistic way, incorporating system variables and parameters. This framework is applied to a deterministic, dynamic model of a coral reef benthos. The resulting stochastic model indicates that increasing variance—but not skewness—is consistently found in system dynamics approaching a critical threshold of grazing pressure. Even if the threshold is breached, attraction of transient dynamics by a saddle point provides an opportunity for regime shift reversal by management intervention. These results suggest that early warning signals of regime shifts can arise intrinsically in endogenous dynamics and can be detected without reliance on random environmental forcings.},

	abstract = {Transitions in ecological systems often occur without apparent warning, and may represent shifts between alternative persistent states. Decreasing ecological resilience (the size of the basin of attraction around a stable state) can signal an impending transition, but this effect is difﬁcult to measure in practice. Recent research has suggested that a decreasing rate of recovery from small perturbations (critical slowing down) is a good indicator of ecological resilience. Here we use analytical techniques to draw general conclusions about the conditions under which critical slowing down provides an early indicator of transitions in two-species predator–prey and competition models. The models exhibit three types of transition: the predator–prey model has a Hopf bifurcation and a transcritical bifurcation, and the competition model has two saddle-node bifurcations (in which case the system exhibits hysteresis) or two transcritical bifurcations, depending on the parameterisation. We ﬁnd that critical slowing down is an earlier indicator of the Hopf bifurcation in predator–prey models in which prey are regulated by predation rather than by intrinsic density-dependent effects and an earlier indicator of transitions in competition models in which the dynamics of the rare species operate on slower timescales than the dynamics of the common species. These results lead directly to predictions for more complex multispecies systems, which can be tested using simulation models or real ecosystems.},

As pollutant emissions rise in one place, a spatial cascade of declining ecosystem services can spread across a larger landscape because of the dispersion of the pollutant. This paper considers the problem of anticipating such spatial regime shifts by monitoring time series of the pollutant or associated ecosystem services. Using such data, it is possible to construct indicators that rise sharply in advance of regime shifts. Specifically, the maximum eigenvalue of the variance-covariance matrix of the multivariate time series of pollutants and ecosystem services rises prior to the regime shift. No specific knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the regime shift is needed to construct the indicator. Such leading indicators of regime shifts could provide useful signals to management agencies or to investors in ecosystem service markets.},

Recent studies of populations in the field and in the laboratory have used time-series data to confirm some of the theoretically predicted early warning indicators, such as an increase in recovery time or in the size and timescale of fluctuations3–6. However, the predictive power of temporal warning signals is limited by the demand for long-term observations. Large-scale spatial data are more accessible, but the performance of warning signals in spatially extended systems7–10 needs to be examined empirically3,11–13. Here we use spatially extended yeast populations, an experimental system displaying a fold bifurcation6, to evaluate early warning signals based on spatio-temporal fluctuations and to identify a novel warning indicator in space. We found that two leading indicators based on fluctuations increased before collapse of connected populations; however, the magnitude of increase was smaller than that observed in isolated populations, possibly because local variation is reduced by dispersal. Furthermore, we propose a generic indicator based on deterministic spatial patterns, “recovery length”. As the spatial counterpart of recovery time14, recovery length is defined as the distance for connected populations to recover from perturbations in space (e.g. a region of poor quality). In our experiments, recovery length increased substantially before population collapse, suggesting that the spatial scale of recovery can provide a superior warning signal before tipping points in spatially extended systems.},

In this paper, we consider compartmental susceptible–infectious–susceptible (SIS) and susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) models that are slowly forced through a critical transition. We derive expressions for the behavior of several candidate indicators, including the autocorrelation coefficient, variance, coefficient of variation, and power spectra of SIS and SIR epidemics during the approach to emergence or elimination. We validated these expressions using individual-based simulations. We further showed that moving-window estimates of these quantities may be used for anticipating critical transitions in infectious disease systems. Although leading indicators of elimination were highly predictive, we found the approach to emergence to be much more difficult to detect. It is hoped that these results, which show the anticipation of critical transitions in infectious disease systems to be theoretically possible, may be used to guide the construction of online algorithms for processing surveillance data.},

	abstract = {A number of social-ecological systems exhibit complex behaviour associated with nonlinearities, bifurcations, and interaction with stochastic drivers. These systems are often prone to abrupt and unexpected instabilities and state shifts that emerge as a discontinuous response to gradual changes in environmental drivers. Predicting such behaviours is crucial to the prevention of or preparation for unwanted regime shifts. Recent research in ecology has investigated early warning signs that anticipate the divergence of univariate ecosystem dynamics from a stable attractor. To date, leading indicators of instability in systems with multiple interacting components have remained poorly investigated. This is a major limitation in the understanding of the dynamics of complex social-ecological networks. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to demonstrate that rising variance—measured, for example, by the maximum element of the covariance matrix of the network—is an effective leading indicator of network instability. We show that its reliability and robustness depend more on the sign of the interactions within the network than the network structure or noise intensity. Mutualistic, scale free and small world networks are less stable than their antagonistic or random counterparts but their instability is more reliably predicted by this leading indicator. These results provide new advances in multidimensional early warning analysis and offer a framework to evaluate the resilience of social-ecological networks.},

Previous research proposed several types of early warning signals to predict regime shifts in ecological systems such as polluted lakes and semiarid grasslands. This paper explores theoretically the potential of such indicators in predicting demographic regime shifts of invading populations. I analyzed a stochastic differential equation model for the population dynamics of an invasive species subject to Allee effects and propagule pressure. Diffusion approximation to the stochastic model suggests that persistent propagule pressure makes demographic regime shifts inevitable, but Allee effects can lengthen the mean time until regime shifts virtually indeﬁnitely. To compare the potential of indicators, I examined standard deviation, skewness, and estimated return rates of longitudinal population abundance. I found that standard deviation showed a distinct increase as regime shifts became more likely, but skewness and return rates showed no clear trends. This result suggests that standard deviation might be a useful warning signal for forecasting an impending demographic regime shift of invading populations during the period when their abundance is still low.},

Using nonparametric methods that assume minimal knowledge of the underlying structure, we compute separate estimates of the drift (deterministic) and diffusion (stochastic) components of a general dynamical process, as well as an indicator of the conditional variance. Theory and simulations show that nonparametric conditional variance rises prior to critical transition. Nonparametric diffusion rises also, in cases where the true diffusion function involves a critical transition (sometimes called a noise-induced transition). Thus it is possible to discriminate noise-induced transitions from other kinds of critical transitions by comparing time series for the conditional variance and the diffusion function. Monte Carlo analysis shows that the indicators generally increase prior to the transition, but uncertainties of the indicators become large as the ecosystem approaches the transition point.},

Unfortunately, it is very difﬁcult to measure ecological resilience in practice. Here we show that the rate of recovery from small perturbations (sometimes called “engineering resilience”) is a remarkably good indicator of ecological resilience. Such recovery rates decrease as a catastrophic regime shift is approached, a phenomenon known in physics as “critical slowing down.” We demonstrate the robust occurrence of critical slowing down in six ecological models and outline a possible experimental approach to quantify differences in recovery rates. In all the models we analyzed, critical slowing down becomes apparent quite far from a threshold point, suggesting that it may indeed be of practical use as an early warning signal. Despite the fact that critical slowing down could also indicate other critical transitions, such as a stable system becoming oscillatory, the robustness of the phenomenon makes it a promising indicator of loss of resilience and the risk of upcoming regime shifts in a system.},

We used a long-term (13-year) pulse-perturbation experiment featuring heavy grazing and shrub removal to determine if critical thresholds and their determinants can be demonstrated in Chihuahuan Desert grasslands. We asked if cover values or patch-size metrics could predict vegetation recovery, supporting their use as early-warning indicators. We found that season of grazing, but not the presence of competing shrubs, mediated the severity of grazing impacts on dominant grasses. Recovery occurred at the same rate irrespective of grazing history, suggesting that critical thresholds were not crossed, even at low cover levels. Grass cover, but not patch size metrics, predicted variation in recovery rates. Some transition-prone ecosystems are surprisingly resilient; management of grazing impacts and simple cover measurements can be used to avert undesired transitions and initiate restoration.},

We then illustrate the impact of these general arguments by numerically examining the dynamics of several model ecological systems under slowly changing conditions.

Recently, it has been proposed that such loss of resilience may be detected from elevated autocorrelation and variance in the ﬂuctuations of the state of an ecosystem due to critical slowing down; the underlying generic phenomenon that occurs at critical thresholds. Here we explore the robustness of autocorrelation and variance as indicators of imminent critical transitions. We show both analytically and in simulations that variance may sometimes decrease close to a transition. This can happen when environmental factors ﬂuctuate stochastically and the ecosystem becomes less sensitive to these factors near the threshold, or when critical slowing down reduces the ecosystem’s capacity to follow high-frequency ﬂuctuations in the environment. In addition, when available data is limited, variance can be systematically underestimated due to the prevalence of low frequencies close to a transition. By contrast, autocorrelation always increases toward critical transitions in our analyses. To exemplify this point, we provide cases of rising autocorrelation and increasing or decreasing variance in time series prior to past climate transitions.},

	abstract = {Because novel ecological conditions can cause severe and long-lasting environmental damage with large economic costs, ecologists must identify possible environmental regime shifts and pro-actively guide ecosystem management. As an illustrative example, we applied six potential indicators of impending regime shifts to S. R. Carpenter and W. A. Brock’s model of lake eutrophication and analyzed whether or not they afforded adequate advance warning to enable preventative interventions. Our initial analyses suggest that an indicator based on the high-frequency signal in the spectral density of the time-series provides the best advance warning of a regime shift, even when only incomplete information about underlying system drivers and processes is available. In light of this result, we explored two key factors associated with using indicators to prevent regime shifts. The ﬁrst key factor is the amount of inertia in the system; i.e., how fast the system will react to a change in management, given that a manager can actually control relevant system drivers. If rapid, intensive management is possible, our analyses suggest that an indicator must provide at least 20 years advance warning to reduce the probability of a regime shift to ,5\%. As time to intervention is increased or intensity of intervention is decreased, the necessary amount of advance warning required to avoid a regime shift increases exponentially. The second key factor concerns the amount and type of variability intrinsic to the system, and the impact of this variability on the power of an indicator. Indicators are considered powerful if they detect an impending regime shift with adequate lead time for effective management intervention, but not so far in advance that interventions are too costly or unnecessary. Intrinsic ‘‘noise’’ in the system obscures the ‘‘signal’’ provided by all indicators, and therefore, the power of the indicators declines rapidly with increasing within- and between-year variability in measurable variables or parameters. Our results highlight the key role of human decisions in managing ecosystems and the importance of pro-active application of the precautionary principle to avoid regime shifts.},

	abstract = {The realization that complex systems such as ecological communities can collapse or shift regimes suddenly and without rapid external forcing poses a serious challenge to our understanding and management of the natural world. The potential to identify early warning signals that would allow researchers and managers to predict such events before they happen has therefore been an invaluable discovery that oﬀers a way forward in spite of such seemingly unpredictable behavior. Research into early warning signals has demonstrated that it is possible to deﬁne and detect such early warning signals in advance of a transition in certain contexts. Here we describe the pattern emerging as research continues to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A core of examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid regime shifts, a pattern of ’critical slowing down’ that can be used to detect the approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving the sudden change. As research has expanded beyond these core examples, it is becoming clear that not all systems that show regime shifts exhibit critical slowing down, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit critical slowing down, statistical detection is a challenge. We review the literature that explores these edge cases and highlight the need for (a) new early warning behaviors that can be used in cases where rapid shifts do not exhibit critical slowing down, (b) the development of methods to identify which behavior might be an appropriate signal when encountering a novel system; bearing in mind that a positive indication for some systems is a negative indication in others, and (c) statistical methods that can distinguish between signatures of early warning behaviors and noise.},

Critical transitions have been observed in an astonishingly diverse set of applications from ecosystems and climate change to medicine and finance. The main goal of this paper is to give an overview which standard mathematical theories can be applied to critical transitions. We shall focus on early-warning signs that have been suggested to predict critical transitions and point out what mathematical theory can provide in this context. Starting from classical bifurcation theory and incorporating multiple time scale dynamics one can give a detailed analysis of local bifurcations that induce critical transitions. We suggest that the mathematical theory of fast–slow systems provides a natural definition of critical transitions. Since noise often plays a crucial role near critical transitions the next step is to consider stochastic fast–slow systems. The interplay between sample path techniques, partial differential equations and random dynamical systems is highlighted. Each viewpoint provides potential early-warning signs for critical transitions. Since increasing variance has been suggested as an early-warning sign we examine it in the context of normal forms analytically, numerically and geometrically; we also consider autocorrelation numerically. Hence we demonstrate the applicability of early-warning signs for generic models. We end with suggestions for future directions of the theory.},

	abstract = {Most work on generic early warning signals for critical transitions focuses on indicators of the phenomenon of critical slowing down that precedes a range of catastrophic bifurcation points. However, in highly stochastic environments, systems will tend to shift to alternative basins of attraction already far from such bifurcation points. In fact, strong perturbations (noise) may cause the system to “flicker” between the basins of attraction of the system’s alternative states. As a result, under such noisy conditions, critical slowing down is not relevant, and one would expect its related generic leading indicators to fail, signaling an impending transition. Here, we systematically explore how flickering may be detected and interpreted as a signal of an emerging alternative attractor. We show that—although the two mechanisms differ—flickering may often be reflected in rising variance, lag-1 autocorrelation and skewness in ways that resemble the effects of critical slowing down. In particular, we demonstrate how the probability distribution of a flickering system can be used to map potential alternative attractors and their resilience. Thus, while flickering systems differ in many ways from the classical image of critical transitions, changes in their dynamics may carry valuable information about upcoming major changes.},

Nonparametric drift–diffusion–jump models address this problem by ﬁtting a general model that can approximate a wide range of datagenerating processes. Drift measures the local rate of change. Diffusion measures relatively small shocks that occur at each time step. Jumps are large intermittent shocks. Total variance combines the contributions of diffusion and jumps. Nonparametric methods are well suited to emerging technology for automated, high-frequency sensors. Total variance is the most precisely measured indicator. Jump intensity appears to be a useful EWS. Estimates of the drift are highly uncertain unless long time series with many regime shifts are available. EWS computed from drift estimates (such as autocorrelation coefﬁcients or return rates) have low precision and should be used with caution. Nonetheless, in the current state of knowledge, it is premature to disregard any potential EWS.},

	abstract = {Many dynamical systems, including lakes, organisms, ocean circulation patterns, or financial markets, are now thought to have tipping points where critical transitions to a contrasting state can happen. Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called ‘early warning signals’, and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data.},

	abstract = {Interest is growing in methods for predicting and detecting regime shifts—changes in the structure of dynamical processes that cause shifts among alternative stable states. Here, we use locally linear, autoregressive state-space models to statistically identify nonlinear processes that govern the dynamics of time series. We develop both time-varying and threshold models. In time-varying autoregressive models with p time lags, AR( p), and vector autoregressive models for n-dimensional systems of order p ¼ 1, VAR(1), we assume that coefficients vary with time. We can infer an approaching regime shift if the coefficients indicate critical slowing down of the local dynamics of the system. In selfexcited threshold models, we assume that the time series is governed by two autoregressive processes; the state variable switches between them when the time series crosses a threshold value. We use the existence of a statistically significant threshold as an indicator of alternative stable states. All models are fit to data using a state-space form that incorporates measurement error, and maximum likelihood estimation allows for statistically testing alternative hypotheses about the processes governing dynamics. Our model-based approach for forecasting regime shifts and identifying alternative stable states overcomes limitations of other common metric-based approaches and is a useful addition to the toolbox of methods for analyzing nonlinear time series.},

Although resilience has been a highly inﬂuential concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations. A ﬁrst set of methods is based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point. Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natural ﬂuctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of observations as in long time series or satellite images. These generic approaches to measuring resilience complement the systemspeciﬁc knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the resilience of complex systems.},

	url = {https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/32483},
	abstract = {This synthesis provides an ecological foundation for management of the diverse ecosystems and fire regimes of North America, based on scientific principles of fire interactions with vegetation, fuels, and biophysical processes. Although a large amount of scientific data on fire exists, most of those data have been collected at small spatial and temporal scales. Thus, it is challenging to develop consistent science-based plans for large spatial and temporal scales where most fire management and planning occur. Understanding the regional geographic context of fire regimes is critical for developing appropriate and sustainable management strategies and policy. The degree to which human intervention has modified fire frequency, intensity, and severity varies greatly among different ecosystems, and must be considered when planning to alter fuel loads or implement restorative treatments. Detailed discussion of six ecosystems—ponderosa pine forest (western North America), chaparral (California), boreal forest (Alaska and Canada), Great Basin sagebrush (intermountain West), pine and pine-hardwood forests (Southern Appalachian Mountains), and longleaf pine (Southeastern United States)—illustrates the complexity of fire regimes and that fire management requires a clear regional focus that recognizes where conflicts might exist between fire hazard reduction and resource needs. In some systems, such as ponderosa pine, treatments are usually compatible with both fuel reduction and resource needs, whereas in others, such as chaparral, the potential exists for conflicts that need to be closely evaluated. Managing fire regimes in a changing climate and social environment requires a strong scientific basis for developing fire management and policy.},

The rate of fire spread did not respond to factors other than wind speed, in spite of the fuel-complex diversity. A high-intensity fire involving partially or totally the tree canopy and killing all trees was experienced in the older treatment area and in the untreated part of the stand, but the benefits of fuel management were still detectable in the former. Surface fire intensity, crown fire potential and fire severity (including tree mortality) were drastically reduced where prescribed fire had been carried recently.

Fire return interval distributions were modelled with the Weibull function and the estimated parameters were used to calculate regional mean, median and modal fire return intervals, as well as regional hazard functions. Arrangement of the available data into three different time series allowed for assessment of the effects of minimum mapping unit, time series length and use of censored data on the Weibull function parameter estimates. Varying the minimum mapping unit between 5 and 35 ha had a negligible effect on parameter estimates, whereas changing the time series length from 22 to 31 years substantially affected the estimates. However, the strongest effect was caused by censored data. Its exclusion led to substantial overestimation of fire frequency and of burning probability dependence on fuel age. We estimated a countrywide mean fire interval of 36 years and an annual burnt area of 1.2\%. Regional variations in fire frequency descriptors were interpreted in terms of land cover and land use practices that affect the contemporary fire regime in Portugal.},

The Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology was used to assess the possibility of multiple model parameter sets being consistent with the available calibration data. The resulting set of behavioural models was used to assess uncertainty in the predictions. The results suggested that (1) for a given region, the total area burned is much the same whether suppression or prescribed ﬁre policies are used or not; however ﬁre suppression enhances ﬁre intensity and prescribed burning reduces it; (2) the proportion of large ﬁres can be reduced, but not eliminated, using prescribed ﬁres, especially in areas which have the highest proportion of large ﬁres.},

	abstract = {This paper synthesizes and reviews literature concerning climate change effects on Mediterranean forest ecology and management as well as the restorative techniques necessary to maintain forest health, forest yield and biodiversity. Climate change compounded with trends of rural abandonment are likely to diminish forested areas within the Mediterranean basin that will be replaced by ﬁre prone shrub communities. This could be favoured by outbreaks of pathogens, ﬁre and other largescale disturbances. Landscape fragmentation is expected to impede species migration. Annual increments and subsequent income from forests are expected to decrease. Reafforestations are necessary to ensure the presence of propagules of forest species and their site-speciﬁc varieties best adapted to future climatic conditions even though they may be different from the present forest-plant community. Current challenges in biodiversity conservation can only be met by afforestations whose main objective is to maintain ecosystem functioning. A new silviculture must emerge encompassing these habitat displacement and economic concerns while maximizing carbon sequestration.},

	abstract = {The impacts of climate change on Mediterranean-type ecosystems may result from complex interactions between direct effects on water stress and subsequent modifications in flammability and fire regime leading to changes in standing biomass and plant species composition. We analysed these interrelations through a simulation approach combining scenarios of climate change developed from GCM results and a multispecies functional model for vegetation dynamics, SIERRA. A fire risk procedure based on weekly estimates of vegetation water stress has been implemented. Using climate data from 1960 to 1997, simulations of a typical maquis woodland community have been performed as baseline and compared with two climate scenarios: a change in the rainfall regime alone, and changes in both rainfall and air temperature. Climate changes are defined by an increase in temperature, particularly in summer, and a change in the rainfall pattern leading to a decrease in low rainfall events, and an increase in intense rainfall events. The results illustrate the lack of drastic changes in the succession process, but highlight modifications in the water budget and in the length of the drought periods. Water stress lower than expected regarding statistics on the current climate is simulated, emphasizing a long-term new equilibrium of vegetation to summer drought but with a higher sensibility to rare events. Regarding fire frequency, climate changes tend to decrease the time interval between two successive fires from 20 to 16 years for the maquis shrubland and from 72 to 62 years in the forested stages. This increase in fire frequency leads to shrub-dominated landscapes, which accentuates the yield of water by additional deep drainage and runoff.},

The warmer and windier conditions corresponding to a 2 × CO2 climate scenario produced ﬁres that burned more intensely and spread faster in most locations. Despite enhancement of ﬁre suppression efforts, the number of escaped ﬁres (those exceeding initial containment limits) increased 51\% in the south San Francisco Bay area, 125\% in the Sierra Nevada, and did not change on the north coast. Changes in area burned by contained ﬁres were 41\%, 41\% and –8\%, respectively. When interpolated to most of northern California’s wildlands, these results translate to an average annual increase of 114 escapes (a doubling of the current frequency) and an additional 5,000 hectares (a 50\% increase) burned by contained ﬁres. On average, the ﬁre return intervals in grass and brush vegetation types were cut in half. The estimates reported represent a minimum expected change, or best-case forecast. In addition to the increased suppression costs and economic damages, changes in ﬁre severity of this magnitude would have widespread impacts on vegetation distribution, forest condition, and carbon storage, and greatly increase the risk to property, natural resources and human life.},

	abstract = {Wildfires are an integral part of Mediterranean ecosystems; humans impact on landscapes imply changes in fuel amount and continuity, and thus in fire regime. We tested the hypothesis that fire regime changed in western Mediterranean Basin during the last century using time series techniques. We first compiled a 130-year fire history for the Valencia province (Spain, Eastern Iberian Peninsula, Western Mediterranean Basin) from contemporary statistics plus old forest administration dossiers and newspapers. We also compiled census on rural population and climatic data for the same period in order to evaluate the role of climate and human-driven fuel changes on the fire regime change. The result suggested that there was a major fire regime shift around the early 1970s in such a way that fires increased in annual frequency (doubled) and area burned (by about an order of magnitude). The main driver of this shift was the increase in fuel amount and continuity due to rural depopulation (vegetation and fuel build-up after farm abandonment) suggesting that fires were fuel-limited during the pre-1970s period. Climatic conditions were poorly related to pre-1970s fires and strongly related to post-1970s fires, suggesting that fire are currently less fuel limited and more drought-driven than before the 1970s. Thus, the fire regime shift implies also a shift in the main driver for fire activity, and this has consequences in the global change agenda.},

	abstract = {Modiﬁed, more severe ﬁre regimes are developing in the Mediterranean basin as a result of changes in land use and climate. Current ﬁre management privileges ﬁre suppression and tends to ignore land management issues, which may further accelerate the transition to a more ﬁre-prone future and magnify the problem. Fire-smart management aims to control the ﬁre regime by intervening on vegetation (fuel) to foster more ﬁre-resistant (less ﬂammable) and/or ﬁre-resilient environments. Scientiﬁc knowledge supporting the creation and maintenance of ﬁre-smart wildlands is critically reviewed, considering the landscape and the forest stand scales. Fuel management strategies (isolation, structural modiﬁcation, and type conversion) are discussed in regards to their current and future potential to buffer the effects of global change on the extent and severity of ﬁres. Uncertainty in the outcomes of ﬁre-smart management arises mainly from insufﬁcient understanding of the relative weights of fuel and weather-drought on the ﬁre regime. Likewise, linkage between global change processes and the ﬁre regime is not straightforward. Shrublands and, in general, open and dry vegetation types will prevail even more in future landscapes. Decrease in biomass will limit ﬁre incidence over parts of the Mediterranean. However, the ﬁre regime will be largely driven by weather, advising concentration of fuel management efforts in wildland–urban interfaces and in forests and their vicinity; decrease of landscape ﬁre severity rather than area burned as the objective; prescribed burning as the treatment of choice, except in the wildland-urban interface; and focus on forest types that are ﬁre-resilient irrespective of ﬂammability.},

	abstract = {The combination of certain features of ﬁre disturbance, notably ﬁre frequency, size and severity, may be used to characterize the disturbance regime in any region of the boreal forest. As some consequences of ﬁre resemble the effects of industrial forest harvesting, conventional forest management is often considered as a disturbance that has effects similar to those of natural disturbances. Although the analogy between forest management and ﬁre disturbance in boreal ecosystems has some merit, it is important to recognise that it also has its limitations. Short ﬁre cycles generally described for boreal ecosystems do not appear to be universal; rather, important spatial and temporal variations have been observed in Canada. These variations in the ﬁre cycle have an important inﬂuence on forest composition and structure at the landscape and regional levels. Size and severity of ﬁres also show a large range of variability. In regions where the natural matrix of the boreal forest remains relatively intact, maintenance of this natural variability should be targeted by forest managers concerned with biodiversity conservation. Current forest management tends to reduce this variability: for example, fully regulated, even-aged management will tend to truncate the natural forest age distribution and eliminate over-mature and old-growth forests from the landscape. We suggest that the development of strategic-level forest management planning approaches and silvicultural techniques designed to maintain a spectrum of forest compositions and structures at different scales in the landscape is one avenue to maintain this variability. Although we use the boreal forest of Quebec for our examples, it is possible to apply the approach to those portions of the boreal forest where the ﬁre regime favours the development of even-aged stands in burns.},

Adapting to climate change in the face of the uncertain timing of impacts means we must have a suite of readily available options.

Since fire is the major disturbance in the boreal forest, three widely held beliefs about fire behavior and resulting landscape patterns are examined in light of the empirical evidence available. These beliefs are: (1) that there is a ‘natural’ fire frequency for boreal ecosystems; (2) that the landscape mosaic created by wildfire is generally one of small, younger patches embedded within a matrix of older forest; and (3) that forest flammability is largely controlled by fuel accumulation. Despite the apparently logical basis for such beliefs, they are not well supported by empirical evidence. This discrepancy is explained by problems such as failure to appreciate the relationship between number of fires and area burned and inappropriate extrapolations or generalizations from other regions and vegetation types. The most important implications for management are that the natural disturbance processes producing landscape patterns in the boreal forest generally operate at much larger scales than management units, and that humans may have more indirect (through landuse change) rather than direct (through fire suppression) effects on the frequency of wildfires.},

	abstract = {Most forests today are multi-speciﬁc and heterogeneous forests (‘mixed forests’). However, forest modelling has been focusing on mono-speciﬁc stands for a long time, only recently have models been developed for mixed forests. Previous reviews of mixed forest modelling were restricted to certain categories of models only and were generally not considering application and suitability. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the models designed for or applied to modelling mixed forest growth and dynamics and to review the suitability of the different model types according to their intended purposes. The ﬁrst part of the paper gives an overview of previous classiﬁcations, after which a new and overall classiﬁcation scheme is presented. Next, the characteristics of the six modelling approaches that were distinguished are described: distance-dependent stand models, distribution models, average tree models, distance-dependent tree models, distance-independent tree models and gap models. All, except gap models, are close to mono-speciﬁc stands modelling approaches. The second part of the paper describes the main applications of these modelling approaches and presents a critical analysis of their suitability. Applications can be separated between growth and yield studies and forest dynamics simulation studies. Attention must be paid to recruitment sub-models, which appear to be inadequate in many models, but which highly inﬂuence the simulation outcome. All types of model were used as management tools. Stand level simulations ﬁt the yield data better than tree level simulations, as a result of cumulated model errors from tree to stand level. However, tree level approaches seem most appropriate to understand stand growth as affected by competition between individuals of different species. Forest dynamics were mostly modelled using distribution models, gap models and distance-dependent tree models. The latter appeared to be less suitable because of the difﬁculties in modelling 3D stand structure over large periods and areas. Gap models could be applied to larger areas and time periods than distribution models, especially when they included detailed descriptions of the ecological functioning of the ecosystem. In sum the empirical models appeared more accurate in their predictions than mechanistic models, but they are highly dependent on the data used for parameterisation. That makes them unsuitable for extrapolation to other systems or conditions. Although mechanistic models can also be misused, adding mechanistic approaches to empirical observations is necessary to model the growth and dynamics of complex forest systems. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper describes the special needs of forest managers conducting participatory SFM planning in a sometimes-polarized public context, and outlines criteria for designing decision-support processes to meet these needs. These criteria were used to develop a new approach to public participation in British Columbia, by means of a pilot study using multi-criteria analysis of forest management scenarios while integrating public priorities. Researchers, working with stakeholder groups in the Arrow Forest District, obtained public weightings of criteria and indicators for SFM. Alternative forest management scenarios were presented using realistic 3D landscape visualisations. Modelling-based expert evaluations of the scenarios were weighted according to the priorities of the stakeholder groups, in order to test implications for scenario preferences. There was considerable commonality of results among groups, with general agreement between experts and stakeholder groups on scenario preferences. Based on the results and participant evaluations, techniques such as this appear effective as decision-support tools in conﬂict-prone areas. Pilot studies like these can play a vital role in developing a more comprehensive, engaging, open and accountable process to support informed and socially acceptable decision-making for sustainable forest management.},

According to FAO, as of 2000, the world had 3.9 billion hectares (ha) of forests with 187 million ha (5\%) in forest plantations. Drawing on additional surveys and our research, we estimate that there were approximately 204 million ha of planted forests as of 2002. Public ownership comprised 87\% of the world’s total forest area, with the US having the largest share of privately owned forests and almost all forests in Africa being publicly owned. Approximately 1.7 billion ha of forests (43\%) were reported to be covered by forest management plans, and 477 million ha (12\%) were under formal forest protection decrees or laws. However, the degree of management intensity and forest protection actually realized by these reported data is moot. Forest certification includes 121 million ha (3\%) of forests, with 93\% of the certification occurring in the Northern Hemisphere, but most of the deforestation occurring in the Southern Hemisphere. The data provide evidence that many countries in the world are trying to achieve sustainable forest management, and certainly are trying to report data that suggest that they are moving toward sustainable forest management goals. The empirical evidence that forests are actually well managed and protected, however, is often lacking. Enhanced sustainable forest management will require better reporting and verification, more areas covered and enhanced implementation of sustainable forest management criteria and indicators in the future.},

We then discuss traditional and newly developing natural resource policy tools in this context and discuss their applications in meeting the objectives of forest landowners and society in achieving multi-functional sustainable forestry goals in the future.},

Forests will have to adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, storms and ﬂoods. Sensitivity, potential impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to climate change are reviewed for European forests. The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short–medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and ﬁre risks.},

We then use this framework to provide a quantitative synthesis of the eﬃcacy of management strategies in the Mediterranean basin. Our review shows that research has focused on strategies aimed at decreasing risk and promoting resistance in the short-term, rather than enhancing long-term resilience. In addition, management strategies aiming at short-term beneﬁts frequently have unintended consequences on other adaptation objectives and untargeted ecosystem components. Novel empirical studies and experiments focusing both on adaptation objectives and multiple responses and processes at the ecosystem level are needed. Such progress is essential to improve the scientiﬁc basis of forest management strategies and support forest adaptation in the Mediterranean basin.},

	abstract = {To ensure that the best scientific evidence is available to guide conservation action, effective mechanisms for communicating the results of research are necessary. In medicine, an evidence-based approach assists doctors in applying scientific evidence when treating patients. The approach has required the development of new methods for systematically reviewing research, and has led to the establishment of independent organizations to disseminate the conclusions of reviews. (1) Such methods could help bridge gaps between researchers and practitioners of environmental conservation. In medicine, systematic reviews place strong emphasis on reviewing experimental clinical trials that meet strict standards. Although experimental studies are much less common in conservation, many of the components of systematic reviews that reduce the biases when identifying, selecting and appraising relevant studies could still be applied effectively. Other methods already applied in medicine for the review of non-experimental studies will therefore be required in conservation. (2) Using systematic reviews and an evidence-based approach will only be one tool of many to reduce uncertainty when making conservation-related decisions. Nevertheless an evidence-based approach does complement other approaches (for example adaptive management), and could facilitate the use of the best available research in environmental management. (3) In medicine, the Cochrane Collaboration was established as an independent organization to guide the production and dissemination of systematic reviews. It has provided many benefits that could apply to conservation, including a forum for producing and disseminating reviews with emphasis on the requirements of practitioners, and a forum for feedback between researchers and practitioners and improved access to the primary research. Without the Cochrane Collaboration, many of the improvements in research communication that have occurred in medicine over the last decade would not have been possible.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the impact of amenity and biodiversity protection as mandated in national forest plans on the implementation of hazardous fuel reduction treatments aimed at protecting the wildland urban interface (WUI) and restoring ﬁre resilient forests. We used simulation modeling to delineate areas on national forests that can potentially transmit ﬁres to adjacent WUI. We then intersected these areas with national forest planning maps to determine where mechanical treatments are allowed for restoration and ﬁre protection, versus areas where they are prohibited. We found that a large proportion of the national forest lands (79\%) can spawn ﬁres that burn adjacent WUIs. The bulk of the predicted WUI exposure originated from simulated ﬁres ignited outside of conservation and preservation reserves and in dry forests, rather than moist mixed conifer forests. Thus the notion that fuel buildup in reserves on national forests contributes to wildﬁre risk in the urban interface was only partially supported by the data for the region studied. Most of the national forest lands that contribute wildﬁres to the WUI are not within the boundaries of community wildﬁre protection plans, which may undermine the effectiveness of these planning efforts. We used the spatial data themes developed in the study to map conﬂicts and opportunities for restoration and mitigation of WUI wildﬁre risk. The analysis disentangles the spatial complexity of managing landscapes for multiple socio-ecological objectives as part of ongoing restoration programs, collaborative planning, and national forest plan revisions on national forests in the US.},

Scale mismatches often occur as a result of the time-lag between policy development, implementation and observable changes in natural capital in particular. In this study, we analyse some of the transformations that can occur in complex forest-shrubland socio-ecological systems undergoing biophysical and socioeconomic change. We use a Multiway Factor Analysis (MFA) applied to a representative set of variables to assess changes in components of natural, economic and social capitals over time. Our results indicate similarities among variables and spatial units (i.e. municipalities) which allows us to rank the variables used to describe the SES according to their rapidity of change. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in the fact that the assessment of rapidity-to-change, based on the MFA, takes into account the multivariate relationships among the system's variables, identifying the net rate of change for the whole system, and the relative impact that individual variables exert on the system itself. The aim of this study was to assess the inﬂuence of fast and slow variables on the evolution of socio-economic systems based on simpliﬁed multivariate procedures applicable to vastly different socio-economic contexts and conditions. This study also contributes to quantitative analysis methods for long-established socio-ecological systems, which may help in designing more effective, and sustainable land management strategies in environmentally sensitive areas.},

We stratify our worldwide analysis by temporal dimension (short-term and long-term) and by model output (numeric or binary), and discuss management applications.

Many biophysical and socioeconomic factors have been used in quantitative analyses of wildﬁre risk. However, the importance and effects of socioeconomic factors in spatial modelling have been given inadequate attention. In this paper, we use different approaches to spatially model our data to examine the inﬂuence of human activity on wildﬁre ignition in the south west of the Madrid region, central Spain. We examine the utility of choropleth and dasymetric mapping with both Euclidean and functional distance surfaces for two differently deﬁned wildﬁre seasons. We use a method from Bayesian statistics, the Weights of Evidence model, and produce ten predictive maps of wildﬁre risk: (1) ﬁve maps for a two-month ﬁre season combining datasets of evidence variables and (2) ﬁve maps for the four-month ﬁre season using the same dataset combinations. We ﬁnd that the models produced from a choropleth mapping approach with spatial variables using Euclidian and functional distance surfaces are the best of the ten models. Results indicate that spatial patterns of wildﬁre ignition are strongly associated with human access to the natural landscape. We suggest the methods and results presented will be useful to optimize wildﬁre prevention resources in areas where human activity and the urban–forest interface are important factors for wildﬁre ignition.},

Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Aviation, Flood and Fire Management Branch, Publ. 305) is frequently cited in the literature as providing evidence of the effects of fire suppression on the boreal forest. The study is based on 15 years of fire data and stand age data from Ontario, Canada. A re-examination of this report reveals serious flaws that invalidate the conclusions regarding effects of fire suppression on fire size and fire frequency. The fire-size data from the unprotected zone are censored in the small size classes because of detection resolution, invalidating comparisons of shapes of the distributions between the protected and unprotected zones. Use of different plotting scales gives the false appearance of large differences in the number of large fires between the two zones. Stand age data are used to show a change in fire frequency in the 20th century, and this change is attributed to fire suppression. However, no evidence is presented to conclude that this change in fire frequency is attributable to fire suppression and not to climate change. The estimate of the current fire cycle is based on too short a record to give a reliable estimate given the variation in annual area burned. Therefore, this report does not present sound evidence of fire suppression effects and should not be cited as such.},

	abstract = {Landscape-scale wildﬁre has occurred in higher frequencies across the planet. Fuel reduction treatments to ﬁre-adapted systems have been shown to reduce the impact to human values-at-risk. However, few studies have examined if these treatments contribute to ecosystem resilience, or the capacity of a system to absorb perturbation and return to a similar set of structures or processes. We deﬁned short-term metrics of resiliency to test the hypothesis that fuel reduction treatments in mixed conifer forests increased a ﬁre-adapted system’s resiliency to uncharacteristically severe wildﬁre. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that fuel reduction treatments reduced burn severity, thereby increasing protection for adjacent human communities. We examined a mixed conifer forested landscape in the southwestern U.S. that was burned by a landscape-scale ‘‘mega-ﬁre’’ in 2011; fuel reduction treatments had been established around communities in the 10 years prior to the ﬁre. Fire effects were highly variable in both treated and untreated forests. However, analysis of resiliency metrics showed that: (a) treated units retained a higher proportion of large trees and had post-ﬁre tree densities within the natural range of variability; (b) the understory herbaceous community had signiﬁcantly higher cover of native grasses in the treated units, but no signiﬁcant differences in nonnative cover between treated and untreated units; and (c) highseverity patch sizes were signiﬁcantly larger in untreated stands and covered a larger proportion of the landscape than historical reference conditions. Fire severity, as deﬁned by overstory mortality and basal area loss, was signiﬁcantly lower in treated units; on average, trees killed per hectare in untreated units was six times the number of trees killed in treated units. Fuel reduction treatments simultaneously reduced ﬁre severity and enhanced short-term metrics of ecosystem resiliency to uncharacteristically severe ﬁre.},

Not every forest is at risk of uncharacteristically severe wildﬁre, but drier forests are in need of active management to mitigate ﬁre hazard. We summarize a set of simple principles important to address in fuel reduction treatments: reduction of surface fuels, increasing the height to live crown, decreasing crown density, and retaining large trees of ﬁre-resistant species. Thinning and prescribed ﬁre can be useful tools to achieve these objectives. Low thinning will be more effective than crown or selection thinning, and management of surface fuels will increase the likelihood that the stand will survive a wildﬁre. Five empirical examples of such treatment are discussed: Hayfork ﬁres, California, 1987; Tyee ﬁre, Washington, 1994; Megram ﬁre, California, 1999; Hayman ﬁre, Colorado, 2002; and the Cone ﬁre, California, 2002.

	abstract = {There is a debate on which factor, fuel accumulation or meteorological variability, is the fundamental control of the occurrence of large ﬁres in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Its resolution has important management implications, because if the fuel hypothesis proves to be right, then ﬁre-exclusion would enhance the occurrence of large wildﬁres, and prescribed-ﬁres would be a useful tool to ﬁght them. On the other hand, if large ﬁres were just a direct consequence of some extreme weather situations, neither ﬁre-exclusion nor prescribed ﬁre would have any inﬂuence on the size of wildﬁres. Here we present a simple model of vegetation dynamics and ﬁre spread over homogeneous areas intended to treat quantitatively this issue. In particular, we wanted to address the following questions: (1) What is the effect that different ﬁre ﬁghting capacities have on the total area burnt and, especially, on large ﬁres? (2) What is the effect that different levels of prescribed ﬁre have on the area burnt in wildﬁres and, especially, in large ﬁres? The model incorporates meteorological variability, different rates of fuel accumulation, number of ignitions per year, ﬁre-ﬁghting capacity, and prescribed burning. The model was calibrated with ﬁre regime data (mean ﬁre size, annual area burnt, and ﬁre size distribution) of Tarragona (NE Spain) and Coimbra (Central Portugal), and it accurately reproduced both data sets, while allowing for multiple behavioural models and prediction uncertainties within the GLUE methodology. Results showed that for a given region, with its particular characteristics of climate, number of ignitions, and vegetation ﬂammability, there was a fairly constant annual area burnt for different ﬁre-ﬁghting capacities. However, higher ﬁre-ﬁghting capacities resulted in a slightly higher proportion of large ﬁres. There was also a quite constant annual area burnt (prescribed and wild ﬁres together) for different prescribed ﬁre intensities in each region. However, the total amount and proportion of large ﬁres decreased as the prescribed burning intensity increased. So, according to the model, it seems that the total area burnt will be more or less the same despite any effort to reduce it by extinguishing ﬁres or by using prescribed burning. Nevertheless, the effect of the ﬁre exclusion policy slightly enhances the dominance of large ﬁres, whereas the use of prescribed ﬁres greatly reduces the importance of large ﬁres.},

We explored a more wholistic, long-term approach based on priority maps for the implementation of diverse management options aimed at creating ﬁre resilient landscapes, restoring cultural ﬁre regimes, facilitating safe and eﬃcient ﬁre response, and creating ﬁre-adapted communities. To illustrate this new comprehensive strategy for ﬁre-prone Mediterranean areas, we developed and implemented the framework in Catalonia (northeastern Spain). We ﬁrst used advanced simulation modeling methods to assess various wildﬁre exposure metrics across spatially changing ﬁre-regime conditions, and these outputs were then combined with land use maps and historical ﬁre occurrence data to prioritize diﬀerent fuel and ﬁre management options at the municipality level. Priority sites for fuel management programs concentrated in the central and northeastern high-hazard forestlands. The suitable areas for reintroducing ﬁres in natural ecosystems located in scattered municipalities with ample lightning ignitions and minimal human presence. Priority areas for ignition prevention programs were mapped to populated coastal municipalities and main transportation corridors. Landscapes where ﬁre suppression is the principal long-term strategy concentrated in agricultural plains with a high density of ignitions. Localized programs to build defensible space and improve self-protection on communities could be emphasized in the coastal wildland-urban interface and inner intermix areas from Barcelona and Gerona. We discuss how the results of this study can facilitate collaborative landscape planning and identify the constraints that prevent a longer term and more eﬀective solution to better coexist with ﬁre in southern European regions.},

	abstract = {In this paper we investigate spatial-temporal associations of fire weather danger and fire regime features from 1979 to 2013. We analyze monthly time series of fire activity (number of fires and burned area) and fire weather danger rating indices (Fire Weather Index, Burning Index and Forest Fire Danger Index) at two spatial scales: (i) regionally, splitting the Spanish mainland into Northwest, Hinterland and Mediterranean regions; and (ii) locally, using the EMCWF grid. All analyses are based on decomposing time series to retrieve differential indicators of seasonal cycles, temporal evolution and anomalies. At regional scale we apply lagged cross-correlation analysis (4 lags or months before fire) to explore seasonal associations; and trend detection tests on the temporal evolution component. At the local scale, we calculate Pearson correlation coefficients between each individual index and the 18 possible fire-activity subsets according to fire size (all sizes, {\textgreater} 1 ha and {\textgreater} 100 ha) and source of ignition (natural, unintended and arson); this analysis is applied to both cycles, temporal and anomalies series. Results suggest that weather controls seasonal fire activity although it has limited influence on temporal evolution, i.e. trends. Stronger associations are detected in the number of fires in the Northwest and Hinterland regions compared to the Mediterranean, which has desynchronized from weather since 1994. Cross-correlation analysis revealed significant fire-weather associations in the Hinterland and Mediterranean, extending up to two months prior fire ignition. On the other hand, the association between temporal trends and weather is weaker, being negative along the Mediterranean and even significant in the case of burned area. The spatial disaggregation into grid cells reveals different spatial patterns across fire-activity subsets. Again, the connection at seasonal level is noticeable, especially in natural-caused fires. In turn, human-related wildfires are occasionally found independent from weather in some areas along the northern coast or the Ebro basin. In any case, this effect diminishes as the size of the fire increases. Our work suggests that for some regions of mainland Spain, these fire danger indices could provide useful information about upcoming fire activity up to two months ahead of time and this information could be used to better inform wildland fire prevention and suppression activities.},

However, the concept itself, in spite of its widespread use, still lacks a clear, widely accepted deﬁnition and there is no general agreement on which features deﬁne it best. In this paper we provide an in-depth characterization and description of ﬁre regimes in three regions – Northwest, Hinterland and Mediterranean – comprising the whole of mainland Spain, to identify their key features. Data on number of ﬁres, burned area, ﬁre season and cause are retrieved from historical ﬁre records for the period 1974–2010. Speciﬁcally, ﬁre frequency, burned area, number of natural/human-caused ﬁres, burned area from natural/human-caused ﬁres, number of large ﬁres (≥500 ha), and burned area from large ﬁres were examined for each region and ﬁre season. We used a multi-group Principal Components Analysis approach to determine the importance of each ﬁre regime feature. Next, climate and socioeconomic variables were explored using Multidimensional Scatterplots and Generalized Additive Models to ﬁnd the extent to which ﬁre regimes are controlled by either environmental, human, or both factors. Results revealed diﬀerences among regions and seasons in terms of the characteristics of their respective ﬁre regimes. However, several common features have been identiﬁed as key components of ﬁre regimes, regardless of region or ﬁre season: ﬁre frequency, number of large ﬁres, and burned area from natural ﬁres. In addition, results conﬁrm that ﬁre regime in the Northwest area mainly depends on human activity, especially during winter, in contrast to the Mediterranean region.},

In recent years, Pinus nigra forests in the Mediterranean basin have been dramatically affected by the new risk of highly intense and extreme ﬁres and its distribution area has been reduced. New tools are necessary for assessing the management of these forests so they can adapt to the challenges to come. Our main goal was to evaluate the effects of different fuel treatments on Mediterranean Pinus nigra forests. We assessed the forest response, in terms of forest structure and ﬁre behavior, to different intensities of low thinning treatments followed by different slash prescriptions (resulting in: light thinning and lop and scatter; light thinning and burn; heavy thinning and lop and scatter; heavy thinning and burn; and, untreated control). Treatments that used ﬁre to decrease the resulting slash were the most effective for reducing active crown ﬁres decreasing the rate of spread and ﬂame length more than 89\%. Low thinning had an effect on torching potential, but there was no difference between intensities of thinning. Only an outcoming crown ﬁre could spread actively if it was sustained by a high-enough constant wind speed and enough surface fuel load. Overall, treatments reduce ﬁre intensity and treated areas have a more homogenous ﬁre behavior response than untreated areas. This provides opportunities to extinguish the ﬁre and reduce the probability of trees dying from the ﬁre. It would be helpful to include ecological principles and ﬁre behavior criteria in silvicultural treatment guidelines in order to perform more efﬁcient management techniques in the future.},

	abstract = {Thinning is recommended in overstocked thickets to improve forest structure and reduce high-intensity stand replacing ﬁres. Many studies have outlined the beneﬁts of thinning for forest growth and reproduction but eﬀectiveness in ﬁre intensity needs more attention. Moreover, the eﬀect that slash generated by thinning may have on ﬁre behavior has been seldom explored. Here we simulated ﬁre behavior on unthinned and thinned Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) thickets in Catalonia (Northeast Spain) where woody residues were left in situ. Furthermore, we simulated ﬁre behavior one year later considering the reduction in the dead fuel load, using decomposition rates empirically determined under high and low rainfall. We could also assess the accuracy of our simulations by measuring ﬁre severity on trees in the same study area after a real wildﬁre. Simulations predicted that thinning prevents the occurrence of active crown ﬁres and reduces mean ﬂame length (from 6.2 ± 0.8 to 1.5 ± 0.2 m), the rate of ﬁre spread (from 5.4 ± 0.9 to 0.9 ± 0.1 m min−1) and the ﬁreline intensity (from 3631 ± 686 to 446 ± 70 kW m−1) compared to unthinned thickets. In the thinned stands these parameters further decrease one year later owing to the decomposition of woody residues. Decomposition of woody residues was observed to be faster under a high rainfall scenario leading to a reduction in simulated ﬂame length and ﬁre intensity twice as fast as under low rainfall. In accordance with the lack of active crown ﬁres and the lower ﬂame length predicted for thinned thickets, ﬁre severity observed after a real wildﬁre in the study area was lower in thinned than in unthinned stands (respectively, 2.02 ± 0.13 vs. 2.93 ± 0.15 in a scale of 0–4). The agreement between simulations that predicted a reduction in ﬁre intensity in thinned thickets and the lower ﬁre damage (ﬁre severity) observed conﬁrms the beneﬁts of thinning young P. halepensis thickets to reduce ﬁre eﬀects. Moreover, our results indicate that leaving woody residues in situ after the thinning of these young thickets does not increase ﬁre intensity. Yet, the inﬂuence of precipitation on the decomposition of woody residues highlights the uncertainties that an increase in drought in Mediterranean-type climates may have in the behavior of future ﬁre events.},

	abstract = {Prescribed burning is being widely used in ﬁre-prone forests to modify stand structure, reduce risks of severe wildﬁre, and increase ecosystem resilience to natural disturbances. This study focuses on changes to understory cover, phytovolume, and species richness eight to nine years after underburning, by comparing the understory structure of burned and paired unburned (100 m2) plots in eight Mediterranean pine stand locations (Catalonia, Spain). Taking into account the assumptions of the space-for-time substitution in our study design, phytovolume was signiﬁcantly lower in burned plots compared to the unburned plots. These differences varied, however, across localities, ranging from negligible changes to a reduction of more than 90\%. Differences attributable to management were greater in forest plots with higher overstory cover, which was assessed by hemispherical photograph analysis. This result suggests that the lack of light availability may limit the reestablishment of understory in managed dense stands. Crown Fire Initiation and Spread (CFIS) simulations indicated that these changes in understory structure would only decrease the behavior of a potential wildﬁre when occurring in low or moderate weather conditions. In both burned and unburned plots, woody obligate resprouters represented more than 60\% of the total cover, while facultative resprouters or obligate seeders accounted for less than 20\%. No differences were detected in the richness of resprouter, seeder, graminoid or legume functional groups between burned and unburned plots. Our results support the application of prescribed ﬁres to reduce surface fuels in the studied forest types, and the hypothesis that fuel load reduction is most effective in a forest with a closed overstory.},

From a review of provincial forest fire records and the assessment of the age of fire-initiated forest stands, it appears that large but rare fires occurred during the presettlement period on both sides of the border. After 1916, due to slash and burn activities, the agricultural region (Que) had proportionally about twice the burned areas and ten times more fires than the forestry region (Ont). Despite differences in population density, road network, and land use, fire size class occurrence did not differ between landscapes over time. However, the occurrence of fires larger than 100 ha, considering three development phases (1916–1939; 1940–1969; 1970–1998), decreased in both regions from settlement to the present, particularly during the late phase (1970–1998) in the agricultural region. An analysis of fluctuations in the Canadian forest Fire Weather Index system (FWI), a rating of fire danger severity, showed major climatic stresses at the beginning of the century (1916–1924), followed by a decrease in the occurrence of extreme FWI values. Combined with the impact of climate, which affected the annual area burned and the number of large fires in both landscapes, the results suggest that the landscape fragmentation, the increase in the percentage of deciduous trees over time and/or effective fire detection by residents led to a decrease in the number of fires larger than 100 ha on the agricultural side for the late phase (1970–1998).

Forest ﬁres are one of the major types of natural disturbances in many forest landscapes. Existing ﬁre regime models can be used in evaluating the inﬂuence of a ﬁre regime on landscape dynamics, but these models require users to deﬁne ﬁre frequency and its size distribution as separate characteristics of a ﬁre regime before running the models. By using a long-term spatial ﬁre regime model, we tested the hypothesis that ﬁre frequency and its size distribution are correlated with each other under natural conditions. Our study demonstrates that the hypothesis can not be rejected and the correlation between ﬁre frequency and its size distribution was robust. Thus, the natural ﬁre size distribution can be estimated when the ﬁre return interval for a given forest landscape is known, if the natural ﬁre size distribution can be approximated by a negative exponential probability distribution. This result simpliﬁes the description of a ﬁre regime from two parameters to one in some existing ﬁre regime models. This simpliﬁcation is limited to a ‘let burn’ scenario.},

The type and arrangement (including landscape location) of treated areas have been demonstrated to inﬂuence wildﬁre behavior. This study analyzes the response of several key ﬁre behavior variables to variation in the type, amount, and spatial arrangement of fuel treatments for simulated wildﬁres in mixed-conifer forests of the southern Cascades in the Goosenest Adaptive Management Area (GAMA). NEXUS and BehavePlus were used to simulate pre- and post-treatment stand-level ﬁre behavior. Fire area simulator (FARSITE) was used to simulate landscape-level wildﬁre behavior in both untreated and treated forest landscapes. In the forest landscape, treatment areas were placed in the landscape according to two strategically designed arrangements and one random treatment arrangement. Treatments included thinning by prescribed burning (burn-only), mechanical thinning (mechanical-only), mechanical thinning followed by burning (mechanical-burn), and no treatment (control). At the stand level, the mechanical-burn treatment most effectively reduced both surface ﬁre (e.g., decreased ﬂame length) and crown ﬁre behavior (e.g., torching index). At the landscape level, treatment type, amount, and arrangement had important effects on both ﬁre spread and ﬁre intensity. In this landscape the most effective treatment arrangement was Finney’s optimal SPLATs design. This study shows that there is potential to efﬁciently reduce high-intensity ﬁre behavior while treating less area by relying on strategically placed treatments. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of forest thinning and burning treatments on restoring ﬁre behavior attributes in western USA pine forests. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), with co-occurring species, are adapted to a disturbance regime of frequent surface ﬁres, but extended ﬁre exclusion and other factors have led to historically uncharacteristically dense stands and high fuel loadings, supporting high-severity ﬁres. Treatments to begin to reverse these changes and reduce fuel hazards have been tested experimentally and observations of wildﬁre behavior in treated stands have also been reported. Using a systematic review methodology, we found 54 studies with quantitative data suitable for meta-analysis. Combined treatments (thinning + burning) tended to have the greatest effect on reducing surface fuels and stand density, and raising modeled crowning and torching indices, as compared to burning or thinning alone. However, changes in canopy base height and canopy bulk density were not consistently related to treatment intensity, as measured by basal area reduction. There are a number of qualiﬁcations to the ﬁndings. First, because it is not feasible to subject treated areas to severe ﬁre experimentally, inferences about potential ﬁre behavior rely on imperfect modeling techniques. Second, research has not been carried uniformly over the ranges of the pine forests, although we found no signiﬁcant differences in treatment effects between regions or forest types. Overall, however, meta-analysis of the literature to date strongly indicates that thinning and/or burning treatments do have effects consistent with the restoration of low-severity ﬁre behavior.},

	abstract = {The prevailing paradigm in the western U.S. is that the increase in stand-replacing wildﬁres in historically frequent-ﬁre dry forests is due to unnatural fuel loads that have resulted from management activities including ﬁre suppression, logging, and grazing, combined with more severe drought conditions and increasing temperatures. To counteract unnaturally high fuel loads, fuel reduction treatments which are designed to reduce ﬁre hazard and improve overall ecosystem functioning have been increasing over the last decade. However, until recently much of what we knew about treatment effectiveness was based on modeling and predictive studies. Now, there are many examples of wildﬁres burning through both treated and untreated areas, and the effectiveness of treatments versus no action can be evaluated empirically. We carried out a systematic review to address the question: Are fuel treatments effective at achieving ecological and social (saving human lives and property) objectives? We found 56 studies addressing fuel treatment effectiveness in 8 states in the western US. There was general agreement that thin + burn treatments had positive effects in terms of reducing ﬁre severity, tree mortality, and crown scorch. In contrast, burning or thinning alone had either less of an effect or none at all, compared to untreated sites. Most studies focused on carbon storage agreed that treatments do not necessarily store more carbon after wildﬁre, but result in less post-wildﬁre emissions and less carbon loss in a wildﬁre due to tree mortality. Understory responses are mixed across all treatments, and the response of other ecological attributes (e.g., soil, wildlife, water, insects) to treatment post-wildﬁre represents an important data gap; we provide a detailed agenda for future research. Overall, evidence is strong that thin + burn treatments meet the goal of reducing ﬁre severity, and more research is needed to augment the few studies that indicate treatments protect human lives and property.},

This paper (1) summarizes objectives, methods, and expected outcomes of fuel treatments in forests of the Interior West, (2) highlights common misunderstandings and areas of disagreement, and (3) synthesizes relevant literature to establish a common ground for future discussion and planning. It is important to understand the strengths and limitations of fuel treatments to evaluate their potential to achieve an objective, develop sensible ﬁre management policies, and plan for their effective use.

Long-term prediction is intended for long-term planning which may serve to characterize and cluster regions as subject to high or low ﬁre risk. This will enable the development of a rational and sensible forest ﬁre prevention and protection policy. The problem with the existing approaches of long-term forest ﬁre risk clustering is that they use crisp sets applying speciﬁc cluster boundaries. On the other hand, fuzzy algebra can provide reliable and ﬂexible means of modeling that can be applied by a suitable decision support system. Given a speciﬁc area of interest, the evaluation of the long-term forest ﬁre risk can be performed by the use of a triangular and a trapezoidal membership function. The decision support system that has been developed applies an inference mechanism that is based on various aspects of fuzzy sets and fuzzy machine learning techniques. The system has been applied in Greece, but it can be used on a global basis. Results show that the system successfully estimates the forest ﬁre risky areas.},

	abstract = {A simulation system was developed to explore how fuel treatments placed in topologically random and optimal spatial patterns affect the growth and behaviour oflarge fires when implemented at different rates over the course of five decades. The system consisted of a forest and fuel dynamics simulation module (Forest Vegetation Simulator, FVS), logic for deriving fuel model dynamics from FVS output, a spatial fuel treatment optimisation program, and a spatial fire growth and behaviour model to evaluate the performance of the treatments in modifying large fire growth. Simulations were performed for three study areas: Sanders County in western Montana, the Stanislaus National Forest in California, and the Blue Mountains in south-eastern Washington. For different spatial treatment strategies, the results illustrated that the rate of fuel treatment (percentage of land area treated per decade) competes against the rates of fuel recovery to determine how fuel treatments contribute to multidecade cumulative impacts on the response variables. Using fuel treatment prescriptions that simulate thinning and prescribed burning, fuel treatment arrangements that are optimal in disrupting the growth oflarge fires require at least I to 2\% ofthe landscape to be treated each year. Randomly arranged units with the same treatment prescriptions require about twice that rate to produce the same fire growth reduction. The results also show that the topological fuel treatment optimisation tends to balance maintenance of previous units with treatment of new units. For example, with 2\% landscape treatment annually, fewer than 5\% of the units received three or more treatments in five decades with most being treated only once or twice and ""'-35\% remaining untreated after five decades.},

However, wildﬁre size and intensity are not only related to fuel loads but also to a wide range of other spatially related factors such as topography, weather and human activity. In prioritizing fuel reduction treatments, we propose using burn probability to account for the effects of spatially related factors that can affect wildﬁre size and intensity. Our burn probability incorporated fuel load, ignition probability, and spread probability (spatial controls to wildﬁre) at a particular location across a landscape. Our goal was to assess differences in reducing wildﬁre size and intensity using fuel-load and burn-probability based treatment prioritization approaches. Our study was conducted in a boreal forest in northeastern China. We derived a fuel load map from a stand map and a burn probability map based on historical ﬁre records and potential wildﬁre spread pattern. The burn probability map was validated using historical records of burned patches. We then simulated 100 ignitions and six fuel reduction treatments to compare ﬁre size and intensity under two approaches of fuel treatment prioritization. We calibrated and validated simulated wildﬁres against historical wildﬁre data. Our results showed that fuel reduction treatments based on burn probability were more effective at reducing simulated wildﬁre size, mean and maximum rate of spread, and mean ﬁre intensity, but less effective at reducing maximum ﬁre intensity across the burned landscape than treatments based on fuel load. Thus, contributions from both fuels and spatially related factors should be considered for each fuel reduction treatment.},

However, how to place treatment units across a landscape and assess its effectiveness is difﬁcult for landscapescale fuel management planning. In this study, we used a spatially explicit simulation model (LANDIS) to conduct wildﬁre risk assessments and optimize the placement of fuel treatments at the landscape scale. We ﬁrst calculated a baseline burn probability map from empirical data (fuel, topography, weather, and ﬁre ignition and size data) to assess ﬁre risk. We then prioritized landscape-scale fuel treatment based on maps of burn probability and fuel loads (calculated from the interactions among tree composition, stand age, and disturbance history), and compared their effects on reducing ﬁre risk. The burn probability map described the likelihood of burning on a given location; the fuel load map described the probability that a high fuel load will accumulate on a given location. Fuel treatment based on the burn probability map speciﬁed that stands with high burn probability be treated ﬁrst, while fuel treatment based on the fuel load map speciﬁed that stands with high fuel loads be treated ﬁrst. Our results indicated that fuel treatment based on burn probability greatly reduced the burned area and number of ﬁres of different intensities. Fuel treatment based on burn probability also produced more dispersed and smaller high-risk ﬁre patches and therefore can improve efﬁciency of subsequent ﬁre suppression. The strength of our approach is that more model components (e.g., succession, fuel, and harvest) can be linked into LANDIS to map the spatially explicit wildﬁre risk and its dynamics to fuel management, vegetation dynamics, and harvesting.},

	abstract = {The assumption that increased wildﬁre incidence in the Mediterranean Basin during the last decades is an outcome of changes in land use warrants an objective analysis. In this study we examine how annual area burned (BA) in the Portuguese public forest varied in relation to environmental and humaninﬂuenced drivers during the 1943e2011 period. Fire behaviour models were used to describe fuel hazard considering biomass removal, cover type changes, area burned, post-disturbance fuel accumulation, forest age-classes distribution and fuel connectivity. Biomass removal decreased rapidly beyond the 1940s, which, along with afforestation, increased fuel hazard until the 1980s; a subsequent decline was caused by increased ﬁre activity. Change point analysis indicates upward shifts in BA in 1952 and in 1973, both corresponding to six-fold increases. Fire weather (expressed by the 90th percentile of the Canadian FWI during summer) increased over the study period, accounting for 18 and 36\% of log(BA) variation before 1974 and after 1973, respectively. Regression modelling indicates that BA responds positively to ﬁre weather, fuel hazard and number of ﬁres in descending order of importance; presummer and 2-year lagged precipitation respectively decrease and increase BA, but the effects are minor and non-signiﬁcant when both variables are included in the model. Land use conﬂicts (expressed through more ﬁres) played a role, but it was afforestation and agricultural abandonment that supported the ﬁre regime shifts, explaining weather-drought as the current major driver of BA as well. We conclude that bottom-up factors, i.e. human-induced changes in landscape ﬂammability and ignition density, can enhance or override the inﬂuence of weather-drought on the ﬁre regime in Mediterranean humid regions. A more relevant role of fuel control in ﬁre management policies and practices is warranted by our ﬁndings.},

Beyond the unpredictability of wildﬁre behavior, uncertainty stems from inaccurate/missing data, limited resource value measures to guide prioritization across ﬁres and resources at risk, and an incomplete scientiﬁc understanding of ecological response to ﬁre, of ﬁre behavior response to treatments, and of spatiotemporal dynamics involving disturbance regimes and climate change. This work attempts to systematically align sources of uncertainty with the most appropriate decision support methodologies, in order to facilitate costeffective, risk-based wildﬁre planning efforts. We review the state of wildﬁre risk assessment and management, with a speciﬁc focus on uncertainties challenging implementation of integrated risk assessments that consider a suite of human and ecological values. Recent advances in wildﬁre simulation and geospatial mapping of highly valued resources have enabled robust risk-based analyses to inform planning across a variety of scales, although improvements are needed in ﬁre behavior and ignition occurrence models. A key remaining challenge is a better characterization of non-market resources at risk, both in terms of their response to ﬁre and how society values those resources. Our ﬁndings echo earlier literature identifying wildﬁre effects analysis and value uncertainty as the primary challenges to integrated wildﬁre risk assessment and wildﬁre management. We stress the importance of identifying and characterizing uncertainties in order to better quantify and manage them. Leveraging the most appropriate decision support tools can facilitate wildﬁre risk assessment and ideally improve decisionmaking.},

	abstract = {Wildﬁre management has been struggling in recent years with escalating devastation, expenditures, and complexity. Given the copious factors involved and the complexity of their interactions, uncertainty in the outcomes is a prominent feature of wildﬁre management strategies, at both policy and operational levels. Improvements in risk handling and in risk-based decision support tools have therefore a key role in addressing these challenges. In this paper, we review key systems created to support wildﬁre management decision-making at different levels and scales, and describe their evolution from an initial focus on landscape-level ﬁre growth simulation and burn probability assessment, to the incorporation of exposure and economic loss potential (allowing the translation of ignition likelihood, ﬁre environment – terrain, fuels, and weather – and suppression efﬁcacy into potential ﬁre effects), the integration with forest management and planning, and more recently, to developments in the assessment of values at risk, including real-time assessment. This evolution is linked to a progressive widening of the scope of usage of these systems, from an initial more limited application to risk assessment, to the subsequent inclusion of functionality enabling their utilization in the context of risk management, and more recently, to their explicit casting in the broader societal context of risks and decisions, from a risk governance perspective. This joint evolution can be seen as the result of a simultaneous pull from methodological progresses in risk handling, and push from technological progress in wildﬁre management decision support tools, as well as more broadly in computational power. We identify the key beneﬁts and challenges in the development and adoption of these systems, as well as future plausible research trends.},

	abstract = {Forest ﬁres are a serious management challenge in many regions, complicating the appropriate allocation to suppression and prevention efforts. Using a System Dynamics (SD) model, this paper explores how interactions between physical and political systems in forest ﬁre management impact the effectiveness of different allocations. A core issue is that apparently sound management can have unintended consequences. An instinctive management response to periods of worsening ﬁre severity is to increase ﬁre suppression capacity, an approach with immediate appeal as it directly treats the symptom of devastating ﬁres and appeases the public. However, the SD analysis indicates that a policy emphasizing suppression can degrade the long-run effectiveness of forest ﬁre management. By crowding out efforts to preventative fuel removal, it exacerbates fuel loads and leads to greater ﬁres, which further balloon suppression budgets. The business management literature refers to this problem as the ﬁreﬁghting trap, wherein focus on ﬁxing problems diverts attention from preventing them, and thus leads to inferior outcomes. The paper illustrates these phenomena through a case study of Portugal, showing that a balanced approach to suppression and prevention efforts can mitigate the self-reinforcing consequences of this trap, and better manage long-term ﬁre damages. These insights can help policymakers and ﬁre managers better appreciate the interconnected systems in which their authorities reside and the dynamics that may undermine seemingly rational management decisions.},

In this paper, we analyse how culture and societal dynamics inﬂuence those connections and, at the same time, have the potential to eventually hinder or foster social-ecological resilience. In order to do so, we take the example of a natural element which is also a cultural icon: the Conch (pronounced ‘konk’). Conch is a marine mollusc with signiﬁcant social and cultural value for the islands’ society of The Bahamas. In the last decade, a decline in several Conch stocks has been documented, calling for an urgent sustainable management strategy. Nevertheless, only little efforts are happening. This case study offers an innovative understanding of resilience by introducing an aspect which is too often overseen: the role of culture in shaping social-ecological resilience. In this case study, the role of culture proved to be crucial as the cultural signiﬁcance and embeddedness of Conch has made the management process challenging. But at the same time, culture can be used as a positive impulse towards adaptive management and as a starting point for sustainability. When culture materializes, it affects not only societal dynamics but also the vulnerability and the resilience process of the entire social-ecological system.},

Engineering resilience (recovery) dominates in the risk assessment literature but this definition does not account for the possibility of ecosystems to exist in multiple regimes. In this paper we discuss resilience concepts and quantification methods. Specifically, we discuss when a system fails to show engineering resilience after disturbances, indicating a shift to a potentially undesired regime. We show quantification methods that can assess the stability of this new regime to inform managers about possibilities to transform the system to a more desired regime. We point out the usefulness of an adaptive inference, modelling and management approach that is based on reiterative testing of hypothesis. This process facilitates learning about, and reduces uncertainty arising from risk and impact.},

Such events may affect the functioning of farm systems and threaten their capacity to provide food in adequate quantities and sufﬁcient quality. The capacity of farm systems to recover, reorganize, and evolve following external shocks and stresses is analysed within the framework of resilience theory. The SHARP (self-evaluation and holistic assessment of climate resilience of farmers and pastoralists) tool was developed to assess the resilience of farm systems to climate change in a participatory way. The SHARP was originally designed for developing countries. This paper outlines the process and changes made to adapt the tool for use in the Swiss farming context, including the challenges and trade-offs of the adaptation. Its ﬁrst application in the Canton of Vaud provides insights on the levels of resilience to climate change for farmers in Switzerland. The results showed that of twenty-ﬁve farmers, “environment” and “market” are two groups of farm-system components where the farm systems are least resilient. The paper provides preliminary comments on agricultural systems in the west of Switzerland that could be explored further.},

	abstract = {A good quality land yields good results to everyone, confers good health on the entire family, and causes growth of money, cattle and grain.” As a source of livelihood, agriculture remains the largest sector of Indian Economy. While its output share fell from 28.3\% in 1993-94 to 14.4\% in 2011- 12 and employment share declined from 64.8\% to 48.9\% over the same period. Therefore, almost half of the workforce in India still remains dependent on agriculture. Given the low share of this workforce in the GDP, on average, it earns much lower income poorer than its counterpart in industry and services. Agriculture faces many challenges, making it more and more difficult to achieve its primary objective feeding the world – each year. By 2050 the world’s population will reach 9.8 billion, 34 percent higher than today. Annual cereal production will need to rise to about 3 billion tonnes from 2.1 billion today and annual meat production will need to rise by over 200 million tonnes to reach 470 million tonnes. Agriculture produces an average of 23.7 million tonnes of food every day. To provide for a population of 9.8 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion in 2100, food production will need to increase from the current 8.4 billion tonnes to almost 13.5 billion tonnes a year. Fifty percent of the additional food required to meet demand in 2050 will need to come from land already under cultivation. Seventy-five percent of the genetic diversity of crops has already been lost. By 2050, two out of three people on the planet will live in urban areas; a large portion of future urbanization will be caused by rural-urban migration (Buhaug and Urdal, 2013) [6]. CA addresses a wide range of agricultural production challenges that include declining soil fertility, increasing production costs; climate induced erratic rainfall patterns and increased demand for food production against severely reduced production capacities of agricultural lands. Solutions are workable options that can be tailored to raising system productivity or diversity, efficiency, resilience, value and profitability of farming, including the enabling mechanisms needed within diverse local contexts. Advances towards building entrepreneurship and resilient farming systems are the most effective and durable strategies, where all stakeholders work together to bring their ideas and support to developing and implementing site-specific solutions that allow for iterative, continuous improvement of the world's food systems and their key components. The paper offers ideas on how these problems can be addressed so as to accelerate agricultural growth in a sustainable manner.},

However, official poverty statistics exclude Swiss farmers and scientific knowledge is rare about how such situations are experienced. This article scrutinises the situation of Swiss farming families living in poverty or material deprivation by intertwining qualitative and quantitative methods to enrich both types of data and interpretations. By statistically comparing farmers with the self-employed in other economic sectors, it uses a novel way of comparing the farming with the nonfarming population. The article shows that the poverty among farmers resembles that of the self-employed with no or few employees in other economic sectors and describes the lived experiences of poverty and material deprivation. It concludes that adaptive preferences make farming families resilient to socioeconomic disadvantage, while possibly leading to a loss of their livelihood in the long run.},

The original study determined the preparedness, responses, and recovery methods of the local tourism industry from interviews with 104 local tourism businesses, and a review of relevant government, media, and organizational reports. This article summarizes a follow-up study undertaken to investigate what the local tourism industry experienced over the long-term after the disaster, what recovery strategies were initiated, the impacts that remained, and how tourism disaster management has changed. The follow-up study includes repeat interviews with 60 of the original 104 businesses, two and a half years after the disaster. A number of surveys conducted by relevant tourism agencies, 1 year after the disaster, are also examined to provide information on intermediate impacts. The aim of this paper is to contribute to what is recognized as a shortage of research investigating the long-term experiences of tourism industries after disasters. The lack of disaster management in tourism is also addressed and a framework proposed to increase tourism disaster management at the destination level.},

	abstract = {North Fennoscandian mountain forests are distributed along the Scandes Mountains between Sweden and Norway, and the low-mountain regions of northern Norway, Sweden and Finland, and the adjacent northwestern Russia. Regionally, these forests are differentiated into spruce, pine or birch dominance due to climatic differences. Variation in tree species dominance within these regions is generally caused by a combination of historical and prevailing disturbance regimes, including both chronic and episodic disturbances, their magnitude and frequency, as well as differences in edaphic conditions and topography. Because of their remoteness, slow growth and restrictions of use, these mountain forests are generally less affected by human utilization than more productive and easily utilizable forests at lower elevations and/or latitudes. As a consequence, these northern forests of Europe are often referred to as ‘‘Europe’s last wilderness”, even if human inﬂuence of varying intensity has been ubiquitous through historical time. Because of their naturalness, the North Fennoscandian mountain forests are of paramount importance for biodiversity conservation, monitoring of ecosystem change and for their sociocultural values. As such, they also provide unique reference areas for basic and applied research, and for developing methods of forest conservation, restoration and ecosystem-based management for the entire Fennoscandia. However, the current rapid change in climate is predicted to profoundly affect the ecology and dynamics of these forests in the future.},

	abstract = {Quantitative descriptions of natural disturbance regimes are lacking for temperate forest regions in Europe, primarily because a long history of intensive land-use has been the overriding driver of forest structure and composition across the region. The following contribution is the ﬁrst attempt to comprehensively describe the natural disturbance regime of the dominant forest communities in the Dinaric Mountain range, with an emphasis on the range of natural variability of regime components for the main disturbance agents. Compared to other forest regions in Europe, the mountain range has a history of less intensive forest exploitation and provides a suitable record of natural disturbance processes. Our synthesis is based on multiple types of evidence, including meteorological information, historical documentation, evidence from old-growth remnants, and salvage logging data from National forest inventories. Taken together, the results show that no single disturbance agent dominates the regime in the dominant forest types (i.e. beech and mixed beech-ﬁr forests), and any given agent exhibits remarkable variation in terms of severity and spatial extent both within and among individual disturbance events. Thunderstorm winds cause the most severe damage (i.e. near stand replacement), but blowdown patches are typically limited to stand-scales (e.g. 10s of ha). Ice storms and heavy snow typically cause intermediate severity damage and affect much larger areas (e.g. 100s of km2). A notable exception was the 2014 ice storm, which was nearly an order of magnitude larger and more severe than any other event recorded in the synthesis. Severe and prolonged periods of drought have occurred several times over the past century, and along with secondary insect damage (e.g. bark beetles), have caused episodes of forest decline. Overall, our synthesis indicates that on top of the background of relatively continuous gap dynamics, stand-scale intermediate severity events are an important part of the regime; these events likely have rotation periods that are less than the lifespan of a tree cohort (e.g. several centuries) and create canopy openings large enough to alter successional trajectories.},

	abstract = {Natural disturbances, such as avalanches, snow breakage, insect outbreaks, windthrow or ﬁres shape mountain forests globally. However, in many regions over the past centuries human activities have strongly inﬂuenced forest dynamics, especially following natural disturbances, thus limiting our understanding of natural ecological processes, particularly in densely-settled regions. In this contribution we brieﬂy review the current understanding of changes in forest cover, forest structure, and disturbance regimes in the mountain forests across the European Alps over the past millennia. We also quantify changes in forest cover across the entire Alps based on inventory data over the past century. Finally, using the Swiss Alps as an example, we analyze in-depth changes in forest cover and forest structure and their effect on patterns of ﬁre and wind disturbances, based on digital historic maps from 1880, modern forest cover maps, inventory data on current forest structure, topographical data, and spatially explicit data on disturbances. This multifaceted approach presents a long-term and detailed picture of the dynamics of mountain forest ecosystems in the Alps. During pre-industrial times, natural disturbances were reduced by ﬁre suppression and land-use, which included extraction of large amounts of biomass that decreased total forest cover. More recently, forest cover has increased again across the entire Alps (on average +4\% per decade over the past 25–115 years). Live tree volume (+10\% per decade) and dead tree volume (mean +59\% per decade) have increased over the last 15–40 years in all regions for which data were available. In the Swiss Alps secondary forests that established after 1880 constitute approximately 43\% of the forest cover. Compared to forests established previously, post-1880 forests are situated primarily on steep slopes ({\textgreater}30°), have lower biomass, a more aggregated forest structure (primarily stem-exclusion stage), and have been more strongly affected by ﬁres, but less affected by wind disturbance in the 20th century. More broadly, an increase in growing stock and expanding forest areas since the mid-19th century have along with climatic changes - contributed to an increasing frequency and size of disturbances in the Alps. Although many areas remain intensively managed, the extent, structure, and dynamics of the forests of the Alps reﬂect natural drivers more strongly today than at any time in the past millennium.},

Here, our objectives were to ﬁrst quantitatively describe the recent disturbance regime of forest ecosystems in Austria (3.99 Â 106 ha). Second, our aim was to identify the main drivers of the disturbance regime, distinguishing slow, predisposing factors and fast, inciting factors. We utilized district-level disturbance observations from 2002 to 2010, and focused on damage from wind and bark beetles, the most detrimental abiotic and biotic disturbance agents in Europe. In a two-stage approach, we ﬁrst analyzed the inﬂuence of slow, predisposing variables on the spatial variation in mean disturbance damage, using principle component regression. Subsequently, the year-to-year residuals from these average damage levels were regressed against fast, inciting factors related to disturbance occurrence.},

	abstract = {Large areas of temperate mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests in Central Europe have been disturbed by windstorms and subsequent bark beetle (Ips typographus) outbreaks in recent years. The impact of these events has been severe, with millions of canopy trees dying in nature reserves, where salvage logging was not conducted. The occurrence of these windstorms has raised the question of whether such events were within the historical range of variability (HRV) of forest dynamics in Central Europe, where disturbances were traditionally perceived as non-natural and without strong relevance for forest development. To answer this question, we analyzed the available historical forest management maps documenting large-scale disturbance resulting from windthrow events in the years 1868–1870 in spruceand beech- (Fagus sylvatica) dominated forests in the Bohemian Forest region (Šumava Mts., Czech Republic and Bayerischer Wald, Germany). We created a cross-boundary forest database covering 54 974 ha and containing information about tree species composition and age, and the severity of the 1868–1870 disturbance, considering the cumulative effect of the windthrow, subsequent bark beetle outbreak, and salvage logging. The age structure of the forests before the disturbances was unbalanced, with stands of 80–120 years underrepresented, and covering only 9\% of the area, and stands older than 120 years, historically classiﬁed as old growth, covering 26\% of the area. Within the decade that included the windstorms and their aftermath, 40\% of the stands in the mountain range were at least partly disturbed, with signiﬁcant effect on the oldest stands. To identify important factors responsible for the severity of disturbance, we constructed regression models relating severity to two groups of explanatory variables: forest stand characteristics and environmental attributes (mainly topographic factors). Overall, stand age was identiﬁed as the most important driver of disturbance severity across the landscape, with the oldest trees most susceptible. The high importance of age for disturbance severity showed the role of forest age structure in determining the scale of disturbances resulting from windstorms and associated bark beetle outbreaks. Nevertheless, despite the documented occurrence of frequent large disturbances during the two centuries that preceded the 1868–1870 events, old growth accounted for 26\% of the area, making it clear that both large scale disturbance and old-growth forest are within the HRV of mountain spruce forest dynamics in Central Europe.},

	abstract = {Disturbances of different spatial extent and intensity play an important role in the Western Carpathian Norway spruce forests. These forests are shaped mainly by severe winds, often followed by bark beetle infestations. Their intensity varies substantially, resulting in variability of disturbance regimes. Low- and moderate-severity disturbances create small-scale dynamics associated with small- and medium-sized gaps resulting from the death of individual trees or groups of them. Large standreplacing disturbances are much less frequent but affect larger areas. In spite of such large variability of disturbance regimes, the structure of old-growth spruce stands varies less, with unimodal diameter distributions being the most common ones. In this review we discuss the possible natural mechanisms behind the relationship between the varied disturbance regimes and the rather uniform tree stand structures. We reviewed a large number of studies done in well preserved spruce stands throughout the Western Carpathians in Poland and Slovakia, which included analyses of the diameter and age distributions of stands and their short-term dynamics, as well as dendroecological reconstructions of disturbances over the last 200 years. The regeneration niches of spruce and accompanying tree species are also analyzed. Two models of the relationship between stand dynamics and stand structure are proposed for Western Carpathian subalpine spruce stands. In the ﬁrst one, severe stand-replacing disturbances hit forests over a large area, resulting in low variability of the age and size of trees recruited synchronously over extensive areas. In the second model, gap-phase dynamics produce spruce stands composed of distinct age cohorts of trees that originated over extensive areas. In our models, different trajectories of forest dynamics can yield similar stand structures, which will not be good indicators of disturbance regimes. We suggest that the abundance of rowan and European larch is a more reliable indicator of past disturbance regimes, because rowan beneﬁts most from gap dynamics, while European larch is connected with extensive stand-replacing disturbances.},

	abstract = {Mixed-severity disturbance regimes are prevalent in temperate forests worldwide, but key uncertainties remain regarding the variability of disturbance-mediated structural development pathways. This study investigates the inﬂuence of disturbance history on current structure in primary, unmanaged Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests throughout the Carpathian Mountains of central and eastern Europe, where windstorms and native bark beetle outbreaks are the dominant natural disturbances. We inventoried forest structure on 453 plots (0.1 ha) spanning a large geographical gradient ({\textgreater} 1,000 km), coring 15–25 canopy trees per plot for disturbance history reconstruction (tree core total n = 11,309). Our speciﬁc objectives were to: (1) classify sub-hectare-scale disturbance history based on disturbance timing and severity; (2) classify current forest structure based on tree size distributions (live, dead, standing, downed); (3) characterize structural development pathways as revealed by the association between disturbance history and current forest structural complexity. We used hierarchical cluster analysis for the ﬁrst two objectives and indicator analysis for the third. The disturbance-based cluster analysis yielded six groups associated with three levels of disturbance severity (low, moderate, and high canopy loss) and two levels of timing (old, recent) over the past 200 years. The structure-based cluster analysis yielded three groups along a gradient of increasing structural complexity. A large majority of plots exhibited relatively high (53\%) or very high (26\%) structural complexity, indicated by abundant large live trees, standing and downed dead trees, and spruce regeneration. Consistent with conventional models of structural development, some disturbance history groups were associated with speciﬁc structural complexity groups, particularly lowseverity/recent (very high complexity) and high-severity/recent (moderate complexity) disturbances. In other cases, however, the distribution of plots among disturbance history and structural complexity groups indicated either divergent or convergent pathways. For example, multiple disturbance history groups were signiﬁcantly associated with the high complexity group, demonstrating structural convergence. These results illustrate that complex forest structure – including features nominally associated with old-growth – can be associated as much with disturbance severity as it is with conventional notions of forest age. Because wind and bark beetles are natural disturbance processes that can induce relatively high levels of tree mortality while simultaneously contributing to structural complexity and heterogeneity, we suggest that forest management plans allow for the stochastic occurrence of disturbance and variable post-disturbance development trajectories. Such applications are especially appropriate in conservation areas where biodiversity and forest resilience are management objectives, particularly given projections of increasing disturbance activity under global change.},

	abstract = {Fire is the dominant stand-renewing disturbance through much of the Canadian boreal forest, with large high-intensity crown fires being common. From 1 to 3 million ha have burned on average during the past 80 years, with 6 years in the past two decades experiencing more than 4 million ha burned. A large-fire database that maps forest fires greater than 200 ha in area in Canada is being developed to catalogue historical fires. However, analyses using a regional climate model suggest that a changing climate caused by increasing greenhouse gases may alter fire weather, contributing to an increased area burned in the future. Direct carbon emissions from fire (combustion) are estimated to average 27 Tg carbon year–1 for 1959–1999 in Canada. Post-fire decomposition may be of a similar magnitude, and the regenerating forest has a different carbon sink strength. Measurements indicate that there is a net carbon release (source) by the forest immediately after the fire before vegetation is re-established. Daytime downward carbon fluxes over a burned forest take 1–3 decades to recover to those of a mature forest, but the annual carbon balance has not yet been measured. There is a potential positive feedback to global climate change, with anthropogenic greenhouse gases stimulating fire activity through weather changes, with fire releasing more carbon while the regenerating forest is a smaller carbon sink. However, changes in fuel type need to be considered in this scenario since fire spreads more slowly through younger deciduous forests. Proactive fuel management is evaluated as a potential mechanism to reduce area burned. However, it is difficult to envisage that such treatments could be employed successfully at the national scale, at least over the next few decades, because of the large scale of treatments required and ecological issues related to forest fragmentation and biodiversity.},

Portland, OR: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. 14 p. (Quigley, Thomas M., ed, Forest health in the Blue Mountains: science perspectives). The fire-adapted forests of the Blue Mountains are suffering from a forest health problem of catastrophic proportions. Contributing to the decline of forest health are such factors as the extensive harvesting of the western larch and ponderosa pine overstory during the 1900s, attempted exclusion of fire from a fire-dependent ecosystem, and the continuing drought. The composition of the forest at lower elevations has shifted from historically open-grown stands primarily of ponderosa pine and western larch to stands with dense understories of Douglas-fir and grand fir. Epidemic levels of insect infestations and large wildfires now are causing widespread mortality that has a profound effect on forest health by adversely affecting visual quality, wildlife habitat, stream sedimentation, and timber values. The Blue Mountain situation may foretell of a much broader forest health decline in the Western United States A management strategy to restore forest health at lower elevations will require that the seral ponderosa pine and western larch stands be managed for much lower tree densities and a more open coniferous understory than have been the case. A combination of silvicultural partial cutting and prescribed fire on a large scale will be needed to produce the desired future condition of healthy, open, and parklike forests. We have attempted to exclude fire from fire-dependent ecosystems with disastrous results. Now we must take bold steps in restoring forest health to the Blue Mountains through an integrated strategy of silvicultural and fire prescriptions.},

We compared strategic fuel treatments located near speciﬁc human values vs random locations, and treated 3, 9 and 15\% of a 68,000 ha study area located in Sardinia, Italy. The effectiveness of each fuel treatment was assessed by simulating 25,000 wildﬁres using the MTT ﬁre spread algorithm. The simulations replicated severe wildﬁres observed around the study area, using historic weather and fuel moisture conditions (97th percentile). Wildﬁre exposure proﬁles for the study area as a whole and for locations with speciﬁc values of interest were analyzed. Results indicated signiﬁcant variations in wildﬁre exposure among and within the fuel management strategies and treatment intensities. The simulated mitigation strategies substantially decreased the average wildﬁre exposure with respect to the untreated condition, and this effect was unequivocal for all strategies. Increasing the percentage of land treated improved the effectiveness of all fuel treatment strategies. The strategy based on road protection provided the highest performances for several wildﬁre exposure indicators. The methodology presented in this work can be applied to facilitate the design of fuel management programs and support policy decisions to address growing wildﬁre risk in the region.

	abstract = {South-west Australia is a region of remarkable biological diversity, predominantly shaped by diversity of climate and geomorphology. Fire has also played an important role in shaping biodiversity over at least 2.5 million years and anthropogenic ﬁre has been a part of this environment for tens of thousands of years. Forest ecosystems are ﬁre-maintained, having evolved traits that enable them to persist with, and depend upon a variety of ﬁre regimes. No single regime is optimal for all organisms and communities, but diverse regimes, within ecological limits, are essential for maintaining biodiversity. Bushﬁres can also threaten people, property and industry so ﬁre management, including proactive use of ﬁre, is necessary to both conserve biodiversity and to reduce the negative impacts of bushﬁres. There exists a substantial body of ﬁre ecology literature for these ecosystems. If on-ground ﬁre management is to advance commensurate with advances in ﬁre science, then this often complex plethora of information needs to be synthesized, simpliﬁed and presented as practical ﬁre management paradigms, policies and prescriptions. This paper attempts to achieve this by describing a range of evidence-based practical ﬁre regimes that can be implemented to conserve biodiversity and to protect human life and property in south-west Australian forests.},

	abstract = {Disturbances and the consequent habitat heterogeneity are natural features of the boreal forest. Natural disturbances occurring at the level of populations, communities and ecosystems (meters to kilometers and years to hundreds of years), that is, at the `meso-scale' may provide useful guidelines for forest management. This approach is based on the assumption that species are adapted to the disturbance regime of the forest-type that they occupy. However, natural disturbance and human-caused disturbance, such as clear-cutting, may differ substantially in their ecological effects. Potential differences occur on several scales. On the stand scale, removal or destruction of important habitat structures, such as coarse woody debris, during traditional clear-cutting may affect species. On the landscape scale, fragmentation may cause local extinctions and hamper the recolonization of maturing sites by old-growth specialists. The effect of these differences on boreal biota needs to be assessed. On the stand scale, the degree of recovery (resilience) of populations and communities after human-caused disturbance versus natural disturbance, that is, the succession process, could be a useful criterion when developing new forestry methods. On the landscape scale, it is important to maintain enough patches of suitable habitat for the old-growth species in order to prevent local extinctions and to promote recolonizations. Natural landscapes could be used as a reference here. In conclusion, although possibilities of matching forestry with maintenance of taiga biota through development of harvesting methods that mimic natural disturbance seem reasonably good, there is an urgent need to establish criteria for the assessment of the success or failure of such methods. The resilience of forest ecosystems as re¯ected in population changes of surrogate taxa after disturbance could be used to guide management. \# 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Because the effects of forest disturbances (such as logging) are often speciﬁc to particular species, sites, landscapes, regions and forest types, management ‘‘shortcuts’’ such as indicator species, focal species and threshold levels of vegetation cover may be of limited generic value. We propose an alternative approach based on a set of ﬁve guiding principles for biodiversity conservation that are broadly applicable to any forested area: (1) the maintenance of connectivity; (2) the maintenance of landscape heterogeneity; (3) the maintenance of stand structural complexity; and (4) the maintenance of aquatic ecosystem integrity; (5) the use of natural disturbance regimes to guide human disturbance regimes.},

	title = {Forest dynamics modelling under natural fire cycles: {A} tool to define natural mosaic diversity for forest management},
	abstract = {In natural boreal forests, disturbances such as fire and variation in surficial deposits create a mosaic of forest stands with different species composition and age. At the landscape level, this variety of stands can be considered as the natural mosaic diversity. In this paper, we describe a model that can be used to estimate the natural diversity level of landscapes. We sampled 624 stands for tree species composition and surficial deposits in eight stand-age classes corresponding to eight fire episodes in the region of Lake Duparquet, Abitibi,Qu6bec at the southern fringe of the Boreal Forest. For six surficial deposit types, stand composition data were used to define equations for vegetation changes with time for a chronosequence of 230 years for four forest types. Using Van Wagner's (1978) model of age class distribution of stands, the proportion of each forest type for several lengths of fire cycle were defined. Finally,for real landscapes (ecological districts) of the ecological region of the "Basses-Terres d'Amos", the proportion of forest types were weighted by the proportion of each surficial deposit type using ecological map information. Examples of the possible uses of the model for management purposes, such as biodiversityconservation and comparisons of different landscapes in terms of diversity and sensitivity to fire regime changes, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Forest fire size distribution (FSD) is one of the suite of indicators of forest fire regimes. It is applied in forest fire management, particularly for planning and evaluating suppression efforts. It is also used in forest management in the context of emulating natural fire disturbances. Given the recent growth in research and applied interest in this topic, we review and synthesise the state of knowledge on FSD, and identify sources of knowledge uncertainties and future research directions. Based on literature, it is common for forest fires to follow the power law probability distribution, particularly the truncated subtype, under a variety of forest types and forest and fire management practices. Other types of FSD are also observed, but under specific circumstances. Although there is evidence that observed FSDs vary both over space and time, the knowledge is too fragmented to generalise the cause–effect relationships for such variation. As well, it is not clear how the various methods of studying FSD and their spatio-temporal scales influence derivations of FSDs. We suggest that a hypothetico-deductive research approach, combining empirical studies with process-based simulations is an effective means to advance the knowledge of FSD. We suggest caution in the use of FSD in forest management because applying different distributions or even different parameters for the same distribution may result in great fire size class differences and thus different implications for forest management.},

	abstract = {Fire is recognized as a keystone process in dry mixed-conifer forests that have been altered by decades of ﬁre suppression. Restoration of ﬁre disturbance to these forests is a guiding principle of resource management in the U.S. National Park Service. Policy implementation is often hindered by a poor understanding of forest conditions before ﬁre exclusion, the characteristics of forest changes since excluding ﬁre, and the inﬂuence of topographic or self-organizing controls on forest structure. In this study the spatial and temporal characteristics of ﬁre regimes and forest structure are reconstructed in a 2125-ha mixed-conifer forest. Forests were multi-aged, burned frequently at low severity and ﬁrereturn interval, and forest structure did not vary with slope aspect, elevation, or slope position. Fire exclusion has caused an increase in forest density and basal area and a compositional shift to shade-tolerant and ﬁre-intolerant species. The median point ﬁre-return interval and extent of a ﬁre was 10 yr and 115 ha, respectively. The pre-Euro-American settlement ﬁre rotation of 13 yr increased to 378 yr after 1905. The position of ﬁre scars within tree rings indicates that 79\% of ﬁres burned in the midsummer to fall period. The spatial pattern of burns exhibited self-organizing behavior. Area burned was 10-fold greater when an area had not been burned by the previous ﬁre. Fires were frequent and widespread, but patches of similar aged trees were ,0.2 ha, suggesting small ﬁre-caused canopy openings. Managers need to apply multiple burns at short intervals for a sustained period to reduce surface fuels and create small canopy openings characteristic of the reference forest. By coupling explicit reference conditions with consideration of current conditions and projected climate change, management activities can balance restoration and risk management.},

	abstract = {In 2014, the Third International Conference on the resilience of social-ecological systems chose the theme “resilience and development: mobilizing for transformation.” The conference aimed specifically at fostering an encounter between the experiences and thinking focused on the issue of resilience through a social and ecological system perspective, and the experiences focused on the issue of resilience through a development perspective. In this perspectives piece, we reflect on the outcomes of the meeting and document the differences and similarities between the two perspectives as discussed during the conference, and identify bridging questions designed to guide future interactions. After the conference, we read the documents (abstracts, PowerPoints) that were prepared and left in the conference database by the participants (about 600 contributions), and searched the web for associated items, such as videos, blogs, and tweets from the conference participants. All of these documents were assessed through one lens: what do they say about resilience and development? Once the perspectives were established, we examined different themes that were significantly addressed during the conference. Our analysis paves the way for new collective developments on a set of issues: (1) Who declares/assign/cares for the resilience of what, of whom? (2) What are the models of transformations and how do they combine the respective role of agency and structure? (3) What are the combinations of measurement and assessment processes? (4) At what scale should resilience be studied? Social transformations and scientific approaches are coconstructed. For the last decades, development has been conceived as a modernization process supported by scientific rationality and technical expertise. The definition of a new perspective on development goes with a negotiation on a new scientific approach. Resilience is presently at the center of this negotiation on a new science for development.},

We present an empirical analysis of five different capacities and assess how interactions between them confer resilience in two coastal communities in Cornwall, UK. These capacities are place attachment, leadership, community cohesion and efficacy, community networks, and knowledge and learning. Based on a survey and focus group discussions, our results show that residents draw on these capacities in different combinations, enabling resilience in diverse ways. This provides a dynamic and socially nuanced perspective on community resilience as process, potentially informing theory and practice of conservation, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and community development.},

Resilience thinking is shaping contemporary environmental policy and its implementation in Australia, Europe, and North America. At the same time, social researchers have raised concerns about the limitations of resilience thinking, particularly in its handling of human agency, power relationships, social thresholds, and the social construction of SES definitions. We argue for a reflexive turn in resilience thinking as a way to address these concerns. We draw on lessons from three Australian case studies where a reflexive application of resilience thinking generated insights for research and practice. We propose six areas for reflexive inquiry: (1) focal scale and level, (2) SES definition, (3) narratives of change, (4) processes of knowledge production, (5) social transition trajectories, and ( 6) social thresholds. In so doing, the assumptions of resilience thinking are politicized and problematized, which improves its theoretical analytical utility, and in practice generates new insights into social processes. Reflexivity offers opportunity for greater cross-disciplinary dialogue between resilience thinking and the social sciences, while allowing methodologies with differing ontologies and epistemologies to be applied in a complementary manner.},

Yet, the model likewise lays bare some of the limits of transparency idea. Bertalanffy's work on the nature of emergent properties, his critique of the stimulus–response scheme, and his perspectivistic account of the systemic perception of the environment all point in the direction of the impossibility of full transparency. Later systems‐theoretic work on operational closure and selfreferentiality has reinforced and even radicalized these insights, which are shown to resonate with some of the key arguments in the contemporary economics, sociology of knowledge, and business ethics.},

	abstract = {The chapter aims to develop a conceptual framework for orienting the resilience-building challenges in planning. In a world in which the only certainty is uncertainty, resilience has become one of the most widely used concepts that has come to prominence in understanding and managing complex systems in the last decade (Welsh, Geogr J, 180:15–26, 2014). The concept of resilience was ﬁrstly formulated in ecology during the 1960s, but it has inﬂuenced many other research ﬁelds. With the advent of the social-ecological perspective, the resilience theory has also inﬂuenced political and human geography and environmental studies, with new explorations and paradigms (Davoudi et al, Plan Theory Pract 13:299–333, 2012). In particular, resilience has become a “pillar” of disaster management, climate adaptation, and regional economic development (Davoudi et al, Plan Pract Res, 28:307–322, 2013). However, the widespread use of resilience thinking has not brought any conceptual clarity but has instead contributed to the fuzzy character of the concept. The chapter ﬁrstly traces the conception of resilience and its three main currents: engineering resilience, ecological resilience, and socio-ecological resilience. Secondly, it presents how resilience can be linked with vulnerability, and ﬁnally it outlines the resilience interpretative approach to emergency management asserted in this work. The chapter also deals with the criticism to resilience in the literature, such as the uniﬁed positive meaning given to the concept and the devolution involving responsibility.},

	abstract = {Since the industrial revolution, humanity had witnessed rapid economic development and technological advancement; but the gains have come at a price. This rising concern gave birth to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in order to address pertinent issue centres on sustainable development. This review begins by giving an in-depth overview of the ecosystem, as a working structural and functional unit. It presents its discussion within the resilience concept, sustainable development, ecological sustainability and adaptive development. It describes the profound imprint we humans have had on nature and ideas on how to deal with the resulting challenges from a socio-ecological perspective. It conclude that managing complex, coevolving social-ecological systems for sustainability requires the ability to cope with, adapt to and shape change without losing options for future development. It suggested that the two useful tools for resilience-building in complex, unpredictable systems are structured scenarios and active adaptive management.},

	abstract = {Seagrass meadows influence local hydrodynamics in coastal bays, resulting in a decrease in the shear stress acting on the underlying bed sediment. The reduced sediment suspension and water column turbidity creates a more favorable light environment for further seagrass growth. This positive feedback is strong enough to induce depth-dependent bistable dynamics with 2 possible stable states, an extant meadow and a bare sediment surface. A coupled vegetation-growth hydrodynamic model was used to investigate eelgrass stability and leading indicators of ecosystem shift under the effects of sea-level rise and increases in water temperature associated with climate change. The model was applied to Hog Island Bay, a shallow coastal bay within the Virginia Coast Reserve, USA, where eelgrass restoration efforts are ongoing. The results indicate that while extant eelgrass meadows are likely to tolerate sea-level rise, an increase in the frequency of days when summer water temperature exceeds 30°C will cause more frequent summer die-offs. This increase in the number of higher temperature disturbance events is likely to push a dense meadow initially located within the bistable depth range (1.6 to 1.8 m mean sea level) toward and eventually past a critical bifurcation point, from which recovery is not possible. We identified 2 leading indicators of a meadow nearing this bifurcation point, both associated with the number of leaves per shoot: ‘flickering,’ which reflects conspicuous fluctuations from one attractor to the other across the threshold, and ‘slowing down,’ which is the decreased recovery from perturbations as a system gets close to a threshold. Our model indicates that the eelgrass in these coastal bays has limited resilience to increases in water temperatures predicted from current climate change models.},

These threats can affect ecosystem functioning, with loss of biotic integrity. Mass-balance trophic models were developed to quantify the energy ﬂow and assess the maturity and health states for three locations in the basin, in two seasons. Quantitative sampling was carried out for plankton, ﬁsh, macrobenthos, insects, benthic autotrophs, detritus, and exported organic matter. Field sampling was supplemented with a literature review to deﬁne functional groups and their diets. Results showed that more than 50\% of the energy ﬂow originated from detritus, which suggests that the systems are bottom-up controlled. Low values of energy transfer efﬁciency, connectivity, omnivory, recycling, mean path length, and ascendency suggest that the freshwater bodies in this basin are oligotrophic, but they are not in a good health and thus have low stability and are susceptible to disturbance, despite the fact that they also have a high number of specialized functional groups, indicative of a well-organized food web, supposed to be representative of healthy ecosystems. The potential of these models to manage shallow tropical streams is discussed.},

A recent review of environmental assessment and reporting at the national level for the United Nations Environment Programme shows about half of reporting countries to be using indicators and provides some lessons learned. However indicators at the national level are not sufﬁcient. The challenges ahead include ﬁnding indicators of change in dynamic systems, establishing sustainability targets towards which national progress can be measured, developing global level indicators of planetary sustainability, and providing individuals with indicators reﬂecting their own progress and providing positive incentives for further efforts. Finally, since achieving sustainability is fundamentally an ethical challenge, a new set of values-based indicators is required to measure and motivate the implementation of ethical principles necessary to guide the transition towards sustainability.},

In this study, taking Jiangsu province as the case study, appropriate indicators were selected in the perspective of compound ecosystem and the rural ecosystem health index (REHI) was developed including four rural ecological subsystems of resource, environmental, social and economic. The comprehensive indicator assessment models and geographic information system (GIS) spatial methods were used to analyze the REH status and spatial differentiation of 57 counties in Jiangsu province. The REH scores of 57 rural counties were in a higher range of 0.686–0.882 and ﬂuctuating increased from north to south, indicating that the rural ecosystem in Jiangsu province was at a relatively healthy level and counties in southern Jiangsu were healthier than those in central and northern regions. The spatial concentration of REH in Jiangsu was poor and the spatial distribution of four subsystems health levels were signiﬁcantly different by spatial Gini coefﬁcient analysis. The REH of 57 counties in Jiangsu province were classiﬁed into 13 types according to the identiﬁcation of the health levels and quantity of four subsystems. Moreover, we analyzed the inﬂuencing factors of each type and proposed paths to promote the development and management of rural ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Sustainability as a concept has multiple disparate perspectives stemming from different related disciplines which either maintain ambiguous interpretations or concentrate on metrics pertaining to single aspects of a system. Given the embedded multi-dimensionality of sustainability, systemic approaches are needed that can cope with interactions of different dimensions. Past efforts for measuring sustainability holistically have taken an accounting approach based on the availability and efﬁciency of resource ﬂows. However, an accounting approach fails to fully incorporate the intensive parameters pertaining to sustainability. An ecological information-based approach is a promising holistic measurement which incorporates both intensive and extensive dimensions of sustainability. This paper evaluates this approach by applying it to six economic resource trade ﬂow networks: virtual water, oil, world commodity, OECD + BRIC commodity, OECD + BRIC foreign direct investment, and iron and steel. From the perspective of biomimicry, it appears that these networks can achieve higher levels of efﬁciency without weakening their robustness to resource delivery. The trends of measured efﬁciency and redundancy of the studied networks are demonstrated to be useful in reﬂecting long term changes while the trend in robustness levels were found to exhibit similar behavior to an ecosystem in its early phase of development.},

The current paper explores how this metric and its related concepts can be used to provide a new narrative for long-term economic health and sustainability. Based on a system's ability to maintain a crucial balance between two equally essential, but complementary factors, resilience and efﬁciency, this generic explanation of the network structure needed to maintain long-term robustness provides the missing theoretical explanation for what constitutes healthy development and the mathematical means to differentiate it quantitatively from mere growth. Matching long-standing observations of sustainable vitality in natural ecosystems and living organisms, the result is a much clearer, more accurate understanding of the conditions needed for freeenterprise networks to produce the kind of sustainable vitality everyone desires, one which enhances and reliably maintains the health and well-being of all levels of global civilization as well as the planet.},

	abstract = {The concept of sustainable development from 1980 to the present has evolved into deﬁnitions of the three pillars of sustainability (social, economic and environmental). The recent economic and ﬁnancial crisis has helped to newly deﬁne economic sustainability. It has brought into focus the economic pillar and cast a question mark over the sustainability of development based on economic progress. This means fully addressing the economic issues on their own merits with no apparent connection to the environmental aspects. Environmental sustainability is correctly deﬁned by focusing on its biogeophysical aspects. This means maintaining or improving the integrity of the Earth’s life supporting systems. The concept of sustainable development and its three pillars has evolved from a rather vague and mostly qualitative notion to more precise speciﬁcations deﬁned many times over in quantitative terms. Hence the need for a wide array of indicators is very clear. The paper analyses the different approaches and types of indicators developed which are used for the assessment of environmental sustainability. One important aspect here is setting targets and then “measuring” the distance to a target to get the appropriate information on the current state or trend.},

They differ in level, focus, orientation, measurement, scale, presentation and intended end-users. In this paper we illustrate that a smart combination of existing methods with different levels of application can make sustainability assessment more profound, and that it can broaden the insights of different end-user groups. An overview of sustainability assessment tools on different levels and for different end-users shows the complementarities and the opportunities of using different methods. In a case-study, a combination of the sustainable value approach (SVA) and MOTIFS is used to perform a sustainability evaluation of farming systems in Flanders. SVA is used to evaluate sustainability at sector level, and is especially useful to support policy makers, while MOTIFS is used to support and guide farmers towards sustainability at farm level. The combined use of the two methods with complementary goals can widen the insights of both farmers and policy makers, without losing the particularities of the different approaches. To stimulate and support further research and applications, we propose guidelines for multilevel and multi-user sustainability assessments. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Those that make and implement marine environmental policy require social, communication and technical instruments that allow them to explore, at a relevant level, the human-induced changes to socio-economic and ecological systems. Also needed is a holistic and integrated approach to coastal management from which a natural extension is the development of Policy and Decision Supporting Systems (DSS). Carrying out the responsibilities of governments requires knowledge and understanding of the relevant socio-economic as well as ecological structures and processes. At present there is a mismatch between the available approach and the information requirements of decision making. New paradigms in integrated coastal zone management can be derived which (1) reconsiders the use of ‘energy’, (2) the application of Knowledge Graph Theory to structure in a logical and transparent way the integral system, (3) the application of Ecological Network Analysis to bridge the socio-economic and the ecological systems and (4) the weighing of explored policy options by ‘public decision making’ based on ‘imaging’ of the results. Furthermore, we contend that the development of these DSS tools requires: - Long-term project research to provide ecological data; - Easily understood and relevant descriptions of systems at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales and based on a good fundamental understanding which in turn requires: 1. A good understanding of the structure, the inherent processes and critical links between variables of each part of the socio-economic and ecological system. 2. The full analysis of non-linear system behaviour by, e.g., (knowledge) graph theory, simulation models and ecological network analysis to know how material or energy is cycled within the systems and what structure links (species) are critical in the systems processes (functioning).},

We argue that because we can only assess sustainability after the fact, it is a prediction problem more than a definition problem. We also propose that in order for evolutionary adaptation to occur, there must be an ordered, hierarchical relationship between the expected (finite) life spans of systems and their space and time scales.},

	abstract = {Sustainability assessment as an ex ante tool for directing decision-making towards sustainability has emerged in a diverse range of forms across the world over the past decade or so. This broad practice of sustainability assessment embraces a wide and continually evolving range of processes, making the ﬁeld potentially conceptually confusing and difﬁcult to navigate. In recognition of this, there have been numerous attempts to develop conceptual frameworks to make sense of the diversity of practice. Through a process of literature review and reﬂection upon practice, this paper builds on earlier work, including our own, to develop a new descriptive conceptual framework for sustainability assessment. The conceptual framework distinguishes two dimensions of sustainability assessment, each with several sub-dimensions: sustainability concept (with sub-dimensions of underpinning sustainability discourse and representation of sustainability) and decision-making context (with subdimensions of subject of assessment, decision-question and responsible party). Drawing upon further literature, several examples of different approaches are then identiﬁed for each sub-dimension, demonstrating the range of approaches evident within current and emerging global practice. Within the ‘sustainability concept’ dimension, the ﬁrst sub-dimension calls for critical reﬂection upon what the normative goal of the sustainability assessment is, while the second refers to how the concept of sustainability is represented in the decision-making process through the use of indicators. Although these two sub-dimensions are closely related their distinction is a key feature of the conceptual framework. The second dimension describes the practical context of a sustainability assessment. The proposed new conceptual framework enables a particular body of practice to be located within the broader ﬁeld, as we demonstrate by categorising ﬁve examples of sustainability assessment according to the framework. We believe this framework has value to both researchers and practitioners, as a structure to guide sustainability assessment research and analysis and as the basis for comparing bodies of sustainability assessment practice within the range of possibilities deﬁned by the contours of the framework. The framework encourages reﬂective practice, particularly in relation to how the concept of sustainability is understood and embedded within the process, and what the practice might deliver. This new conceptual framework is presented as a relatively simple road map and guide as sustainability assessment theorising and practice enters its second decade.},

These actions imply strategic choices and suppose adequate sustainability assessments to identify, measure, evaluate and communicate sustainable development. However, literature is scarce on the link between strategic decision making and sustainability assessment. As questions emerge on how, what and when to measure, the objective of this paper is to construct a framework for guiding sustainability assessment and on-farm strategic decision making. Qualitative research on own experiences from the past and a recent project revealed four categories of actual needs farmers, advisors and experts have regarding sustainability assessment: context, ﬂexibility, focus on farm and farmer and communication. These stakeholders' needs are then incorporated into a two-dimensional framework that marries the intrinsic complexity of sustainability assessment tools and the time frame of strategic decision making. The framework allows a farm-speciﬁc and ﬂexible approach leading to harmonized actions towards sustainable farming. As this framework is mainly a procedural instrument to guide the use of sustainability assessment tools within strategic decision making, it ﬁts to incorporate, even guide, future research on sustainability assessment tools themselves and on their adoption on farms.},

Many key sustainability indicators also lack a consistent deﬁnition of sustainability, have perspectives that are too short-term, and are unable to model the dynamics of complex environmental utilization which can then result in inappropriate projection of long-term sustainability and/or sustainability indication. Here I propose a generalized quantitative framework of environmental sustainability requiring that (1) environmental capacities and utilization rates are identiﬁed, (2) their complex temporal dynamics are quantitatively modeled or estimated (3) while also adjusting for uncertainties, and ﬁnally, (4) using one of three options, determining which cumulative utilization pathways can be sustained for a (usually well-deﬁned) period of time. Using the example of wood volume and its growth as capacities and harvest as utilization, and the example of global greenhouse gas emissions as the utilization component and the capacity of the air to absorb these emissions, I demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied in practice, how sustainability indicators could be developed, and also how they can inform policies and measures to ensure sustainability.},

It is conducted for supporting decision-making and policy in a broad environmental, economic and social context, and transcends a purely technical/scientiﬁc evaluation. This paper focusses on the systematisation of knowledge on technical/scientiﬁc sustainability evaluation, by addressing critical decision-making elements focussed on by domain experts. We make a distinction between integrated assessment and SA. Our systemic approach outlines how to move from integrated assessment to SA. The fundamental differences involved concern three levels: ontological, methodological and epistemological. We present a novel methodological framework for SA, based on a literature meta-review of multi-scale and multipurpose appraisal methodologies, models and indicators. SA is essentially a structured procedure encompassing different ﬁeld-speciﬁc analytical methods and models, for speciﬁc applications and decision contexts. External inputs to the methodology are “values” considered in the analysis and boundaries deﬁned, including the relevant sustainability framework. Internal methodological elements comprise approach to be adopted (e.g. “what-if” vs. “whatto”), scenario design and analytical models and measurable indicators for an operational analysis. Methods to quantify uncertainty are key ingredients of the assessment framework. The paper highlights the relevance of and policy challenges for SA development, with due attention for applicability in real-world decision contexts.},

	abstract = {Though the concept of sustainable development originally included a clear social mandate, for two decades this human dimension has been neglected amidst abbreviated references to sustainability that have focused on bio-physical environmental issues, or been subsumed within a discourse that conﬂated ‘development’ and ‘economic growth’. The widespread failure of this approach to generate meaningful change has led to renewed interest in the concept of ‘social sustainability’ and aspects thereof. A review of the literature suggests, however, that it is a concept in chaos, and we argue that this severely compromises its importance and utility. The purpose of this paper is to examine this diverse literature so as to clarify what might be meant by the term social sustainability and highlight different ways in which it contributes to sustainable development more generally. We present a threefold schema comprising: (a) ‘development sustainability’ addressing basic needs, the creation of social capital, justice and so on; (b) ‘bridge sustainability’ concerning changes in behaviour so as to achieve bio-physical environmental goals and; (c) ‘maintenance sustainability’ referring to the preservation – or what can be sustained – of sociocultural characteristics in the face of change, and the ways in which people actively embrace or resist those changes. We use this tripartite of social sustainabilities to explore ways in which contradictions and complements between them impede or promote sustainable development, and draw upon housing in urban areas as a means of explicating these ideas.},

	abstract = {The resilience of a system refers to its ready ability to recover structure and behavior in the face of external forcing. The term has been used in limnetic ecology for two separate phenomena. In one, it refers to the hysteretic persistence of supportive capacity in the face of a managed reduction in the resource supply, giving perplexing delays in the recovery of lakes subject to treatment to reverse the symptoms of eutrophication. In the other usage, resilience is the homeostatic damping of the effects of chaotic environmental variability on community structure, certainly within quantifiable thresholds, in all aquatic ecosystems. A simple energetic model of ecosystem function is developed in order to assimilate the two types of resilience. Although provisional terms are coined to emphasize their distinction, only structural resilience describes a general property of systems and, which, moreover, assists an understanding of their health and ascendancy. Resourcing resilience owes to the separation of the loading and the growth responses in particular kinds of water body but otherwise reveals little that is not already well known. No strong case can be made for persisting with the latter usage and certainly not without the qualification.},

	abstract = {Sustainability of food production has become the focus of many research projects and has gained a prominent position in the marketing of food products. To gain insight into the sustainability performance of farms, and ultimately support farmers in sustainable development, a large number of sustainability assessment tools have been developed. This expectation has made sustainability assessment tools increasingly popular to measure sustainability. The actual implementation of assessment tools in practice, and contribution of assessments to change, however, is being questioned. In fact, the movement towards ‘better’ sustainability assessment tools is being caught between two conﬂicting trends: the continual proliferation of sustainability assessment tools and the streamlining of market assurance programmes that give the impression of certainty in assessing sustainability. In this viewpoint article, we identify current limitations of sustainability assessments to catalyse change and formulate recommendations to the developers and users of such tools. We argue that challenges of implementation are, in part, related to the ambition of the assessment and their associated level of comprehensiveness. As a sustainability assessment becomes more comprehensive, and covers a wider range of issues or practices, the diﬃculty of implementing the sustainability assessment increases. We also highlight that the implementation challenge can be connected to the credibility, salience and legitimacy of knowledge produced by sustainability assessments. We conclude that increasing the transparency, harmonization, participation and sensitivity to farmer’ motivation in sustainability assessments is urgently needed to better link sustainability knowledge to action and overcome the current lock-in.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development of energy systems requires consideration of all three sustainability dimensions: environmental, economic and social. Current work presents a new decision-support framework for facilitating this. Taking a life cycle approach, the framework integrates the three sustainability dimensions to enable assessments at both technology and systems levels. The framework comprises scenario analysis, life cycle assessment, life cycle costing, social sustainability assessment and multicriteria decision analysis, which are used to assess and identify the most sustainable energy options. The application of the framework is illustrated on the example of future electricity supply in Mexico. Eleven scenarios up to 2050 have been developed considering different technologies, electricity mixes and climate change targets. The results show that, based on the 17 sustainability criteria used in this work, the business-as-usual scenario, mostly based on fossil fuels, is unsustainable regardless of the preferences for different sustainability criteria. This is mainly due to the high costs and environmental impacts associated with fossil fuels. Overall, the most sustainable scenarios are those with higher penetration of renewables (wind, solar, hydro, geothermal and biomass) and nuclear power. These electricity pathways would enable meeting the national greenhouse gas emission targets by 2050 in a more sustainable way than envisaged by the current policy. However, some trade-offs among the sustainability criteria are needed, particularly with respect to the social impacts. These trade-offs can be explored easily within the decision-support framework to reveal how different stakeholder preferences affect the outcomes of sustainability assessment, thus contributing to more informed decision and policy making.},

However, past studies on urban metabolism have focused primarily on the system’s external characteristics rather than on the internal production and consumption processes. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of urban metabolic processes, we present a method through which one can examine and characterize the production and consumption ﬂows intrinsic to an urban metabolic system. Drawing upon several analytical procedures from ecological network analysis, we applied the method to a case study in Beijing, China. We collected a large body of statistical data and used it to account for the material ﬂows inside Beijing’s system from 1998 to 2007, thereby providing a quantitative network model of the system. We found that the paths between different components of Beijing’s urban metabolic system remain simple, that there is insufﬁcient cycling, and that the city’s lack of internal environmental support capacity forces it to depend heavily on inputs from the external environment. These results suggest that the city needs to develop the reducer (recycling) component of its hierarchy to reduce the double pressure on its internal environment created by demands for resource supply and for absorption and recycling of wastes and other materials. This will help Beijing to achieve more sustainable development.},

	abstract = {Due to the important role of cities for regional, national, and international economic development and the concurrent degradation of the urban environmental quality under rapid urbanization, a systematic diagnosis of urban ecosystem health for sustainable ecological management is urgently needed. This paper reviews the related research on urban ecosystem health assessment, beginning from the inception of urban ecosystem health concerns propelled by the development needs of urban ecosystems and the advances in ecosystem health research. Concepts, standards, indicators, models, and case studies are introduced and discussed. Urban ecosystem health considers the integration of ecological, economic, social and human health factors, and as such it is a value-driven concept which is strongly inﬂuenced by human perceptions. There is not an absolute urban ecosystem standard because of the uncertainty caused by the changing human needs, targets, and expectation of urban ecosystem over time; thus, suitable approaches are still needed to establish health standards of urban ecosystems. Several conceptual models and suitable indicator frameworks have been proposed to organize the multiple factors to represent comprehensively the health characteristics of an urban ecosystem, while certain mathematical methods have been applied to deal with the indicator information to get a clear assessment of the urban ecosystem health status. Instead of perceiving the urban ecosystem assessment as an instantaneous measurement of the health state, it is suggested to conceptualize the urban ecosystem health as a process, which impels us to focus more studies on the dynamic trends of health status and projecting possible development scenarios.},

Along with the development of the concept of sustainable development, people gradually realized the importance of natural ecosystems. Ecological safety is the basis of sustainable development. It is a necessary condition to build a harmonious and environment friendly society. A healthy ecosystem is the basic guarantee of the realization of human social and economic development. This paper analyzes the relationship between ecosystem health and ecological safety, and finds that there are many connections and differences between them.According to the comparison of indices in the same evaluation model, the differences are analyzed.

	abstract = {Understanding sustainability requires integrating multiple perspectives and investigative methods to explain multidimensional concepts. However, the traditional approach to research and education is organized along disciplinary lines that tend to exclude awareness of contributions in one ﬁeld that may inform problems in another. This presents a serious obstacle to advancing an understanding of sustainability, which is focused on the interactions between industrial and ecological systems, rather than examining each system independently. This paper offers a broad description of different perspectives with regard to sustainability including security, reliability, resilience and renewal, and brieﬂy describes the emerging sciences essential to understanding sustainability: ecological economics, industrial ecology, ecosystem health, and sustainable decision making, policy and design. In the latter, the challenges have yet to ﬁnd an academic locus. Nonetheless, it is in this area that knowledge of sustainability science must be applied and it is consequently most proximate to business leaders, policy makers and designers.

	abstract = {Farmers have been increasingly called upon to respond to an ongoing redeﬁnition in consumers' demands, having as a converging theme the search for sustainable production practices. In order to satisfy this objective, instruments for the environmental management of agricultural activities have been sought out. Environmental impact assessment methods are appropriate tools to address the choice of technologies and management practices to minimize negative effects of agricultural development, while maximizing productive efﬁciency, sound usage of natural resources, conservation of ecological assets and equitable access to wealth generation means. The ‘system for weighted environmental impact assessment of rural activities’ (APOIA-NovoRural) presented in this paper is organized to provide integrated farm sustainability assessment according to quantitative environmental standards and deﬁned socio-economic benchmarks. The system integrates sixty-two objective indicators in ﬁve sustainability dimensions — (i) Landscape ecology, (ii) Environmental quality (atmosphere, water and soil), (iii) Sociocultural values, (iv) Economic values, and (v) Management and administration. Impact indices are expressed in three integration levels: (i) speciﬁc indicators, that offer a diagnostic and managerial tool for farmers and rural administrators, by pointing out particular attributes of the rural activities that may be failing to comply with deﬁned environmental performance objectives; (ii) integrated sustainability dimensions, that show decision-makers the major contributions of the rural activities toward local sustainable development, facilitating the deﬁnition of control actions and promotion measures; and (iii) aggregated sustainability index, that can be considered a yardstick for eco-certiﬁcation purposes. Nine fully documented case studies carried out with the APOIANovoRural system, focusing on different scales, diverse rural activities/farming systems, and contrasting spatial/territorial contexts, attest to the malleability of the method and its applicability as an integrated farm environmental management tool.},

This research compared indicator-based sustainability assessment tools to gain insight in practical requirements, procedures and complexity involved in applying sustainability assessment tools. In addition, the relevance of the tools, as perceived by farmers, was evaluated. An overview of 48 indicator-based sustainability assessment tools was developed to, subsequently, select tools that address the environmental, social and economic dimension of sustainability, are issued in a scientiﬁc publication and suitable for assessing the sustainability performance of livestock and arable farms in Denmark. Only four tools (RISE, SAFA, PG and IDEA) complied with the selection criteria and were used to assess the sustainability performance of ﬁve Danish farms. The tools vary widely in their scoring and aggregation method, time requirement and data input. The farmers perceived RISE as the most relevant tool to gain insight in the sustainability performance of their farm. The ﬁndings emphasize the importance of context speciﬁcity, user-friendliness, complexity of the tool, language use, and a match between value judgements of tool developers and farmers. Even though RISE was considered as the most relevant tool, the farmers expressed a hesitation to apply the outcomes of the four tools in their decision making and management. Furthermore, they identiﬁed limitations in their options to improve their sustainability performance. Additional efforts are needed to support farmers in using the outcomes in their decision making. The outcomes of sustainability assessment tools should therefore be considered as a starting point for discussion, reﬂection and learning.},

	abstract = {Several international research and development organizations are promoting conservation agriculture in a wide range of contexts. Conservation agriculture is based on a combination of three main principles: (i) minimal or no mechanical soil disturbance; (ii) diversiﬁed crop rotations and (iii) permanent soil cover (consisting of a growing crop or a dead mulch of crop residues). However, in the face of the diversity of practices that can be associated with conservation agriculture, of goals assigned to agricultural systems, and pedoclimatic contexts, there is still no empirical evidence about the overall performance of conservation agriculture in France. Global assessments of conservation agriculture, with the full or partial application of its principles and in different contexts, are required to provide a more comprehensive picture of the performance of such systems. We tackled these objectives simultaneously, by evaluating 31 cropping systems with the MASC® model (for Multicriteria Assessment of the Sustainability of Cropping Systems). These systems were selected to represent a wide diversity of practices, from ploughed conventional systems to crop sequences based on the full application of conservation agriculture principles. Positive interactions were observed between the key elements of conservation agriculture, resulting in better sustainability performances (particularly in terms of environmental criteria). Nevertheless, the systems most closely respecting the principles of conservation agriculture displayed several weaknesses, principally of a social or technical nature, in this study. Careful attention should be paid to attenuating these weaknesses. A more detailed analysis of the results also suggested that decreasing soil tillage tends to decrease the overall performance of the system unless associated with a diversiﬁcation of the crop rotation.},

This task is conducted in three steps: ﬁrstly, we analyse the criteria an indicator should match to be included in an evaluation; secondly, we categorise 15 of the most important agriculture sustainability frameworks to discuss effectiveness in evaluating sustainability for each category, ﬁnally, we compare the categories and emphasise differences to highlight the possible application of each framework and hence guide the practitioner in the framework selection process.

	abstract = {One approach to assessing progress towards sustainability makes use of multiple indicators spanning the environmental, social, and economic dimensions of the system being studied. Diverse indicators have different units of measurement, and normalization is the procedure employed to transform differing indicator measures onto similar scales or to unit-free measures. Given the inherent complexity entailed in interpreting information related to multiple indicators, normalization and aggregation of sustainability indicators are common steps after indicator measures are quantiﬁed. However, it is often diﬃcult for stakeholders to make clear connections between speciﬁc indicator measurements and resulting aggregate scores of sustainability. Motivated by challenges and examples in sustainability assessment, this paper explores various normalization schemes including ratio normalization, target normalization, Z-score normalization, and unit equivalence normalization. Methods for analyzing the impacts of normalization choice on aggregate scores are presented. Techniques are derived for general application in studying composite indicators, and advantages and drawbacks associated with different normalization schemes are discussed within the context of sustainability assessment. Theoretical results are clariﬁed through a case study using data from indicators of progress towards bioenergy sustainability.},

	abstract = {At the UN in New York the Open Working Group created by the UN General Assembly proposed a set of global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which comprises 17 goals and 169 targets. Further to that, a preliminary set of 330 indicators was introduced in March 2015. Some SDGs build on preceding Millennium Development Goals while others incorporate new ideas. A critical review has revealed that indicators of varied quality (in terms of the fulﬁlment certain criteria) have been proposed to assess sustainable development. Despite the fact that there is plenty of theoretical work on quality standards for indicators, in practice users cannot often be sure how adequately the indicators measure the monitored phenomena. Therefore we stress the need to operationalise the Sustainable Development Goals’ targets and evaluate the indicators’ relevance, the characteristic of utmost importance among the indicators’ quality traits. The current format of the proposed SDGs and their targets has laid a policy framework; however, without thorough expert and scientiﬁc follow up on their operationalisation the indicators may be ambiguous. Therefore we argue for the foundation of a conceptual framework for selecting appropriate indicators for targets from existing sets or formulating new ones. Experts should focus on the “indicatorindicated fact” relation to ensure the indicators’ relevance in order for clear, unambiguous messages to be conveyed to users (decision- and policy-makers and also the lay public). Finally we offer some recommendations for indicators providers in order to contribute to the tremendous amount of conceptual work needed to lay a strong foundation for the development of the ﬁnal indicators framework.},

Employing document analysis and interviews of key actors, we explore the use of sustainable development indicators at national and EU level and draw forth lessons relevant for topical discussion of the measurement of human well-being. We apply a conceptual model of three main types of indicator use: instrumental, conceptual, and political. The results indicate that the use of sustainability indicators is mainly conﬁned to the ‘indicator circuit’ formed by indicator-developers themselves and actors obliged to use the indicators. The results suggest that direct instrumental use of indicators shows limited potential, whereas conceptual use is the key for enhanced indicator inﬂuence in the long term.

The following indices are reviewed: Ecological Footprint (EF), Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI), Dashboard of Sustainability (DS), Welfare Index, Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, City Development Index, emergy/exergy, Human Development Index (HDI), Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI), Environmental Policy Index (EPI), Living Planet Index (LPI), Environmentally-adjusted Domestic Product (EDP), Genuine Saving (GS), and some applications of composite indices or/and multivariate indicators to local or regional context as case studies. The key conceptual requirements for an adequate CSI are: (i) to consider environmental, economic and social aspects (the triple bottom line of sustainability) from the viewpoint of strong sustainability; (ii) to capture external impacts (leakage effects) of city on other areas beyond the city boundaries particularly in terms of environmental aspects; (iii) to create indices/indicators originally for the purpose of assessing city sustainability; and (iv) to be able to assess world cities in both developed and developing countries using common axes of evaluation. Based on the review, we conclude that it is necessary to create a new CSI that enables us to assess and compare cities' sustainability performance in order to understand the global impact of cities on the environment and human life as compared with their economic contribution. In the future, the CSI will be able to provide local authorities with guidance toward sustainable paths.},

To support management and restoration efforts aquatic system models are required that are able to capture the often complex trajectories that these systems display in response to multiple stressors. This paper explores the abilities and limitations of current model approaches in meeting this challenge, and outlines a strategy based on integration of ﬂexible model libraries and data from observation networks, within a learning framework, as a means to improve the accuracy and scope of model predictions. The framework is comprised of a data assimilation component that utilizes diverse data streams from sensor networks, and a second component whereby model structural evolution can occur once the model is assessed against theoretically relevant metrics of system function. Given the scale and transdisciplinary nature of the prediction challenge, network science initiatives are identiﬁed as a means to develop and integrate diverse model libraries and workﬂows, and to obtain consensus on diagnostic approaches to model assessment that can guide model adaptation. We outline how such a framework can help us explore the theory of how aquatic systems respond to change by bridging bottom-up and top-down lines of enquiry, and, in doing so, also advance the role of prediction in aquatic ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems are becoming damaged or degraded as a result of stresses especially associated with human activities. A healthy ecosystem is essential to provide the services that humans and the natural environment require and has tremendous social and economic value. Exploration of the definition of ecosystem health includes what constitutes health and what it means to be healthy. To evaluate ecosystem health, it is necessary to quantify ecosystem conditions using a variety of indicators. In this paper, the main principles and criteria for indicator selection, classification of indicators for different kinds of ecosystems, the most appropriate indicators for measuring ecosystem sustainability, and various methods and models for the assessment of ecosystem health are presented. Drivers, sustainability, and resilience are considered to be critical factors for ecosystem health and its assessment. Effective integration of ecological understanding with socioeconomic, biophysical, biogeochemical, and public-policy dimensions is still the primary challenge in this field, and devising workable strategies to achieve and maintain ecosystem health is a key future challenge.},

	abstract = {A comparison of a Norwegian and two Canadian management plans reveals that most of the measures in the Norwegian plan were put into practice, whereas the Canadian plans did not result in the implementation of any new measures. This paper applies implementation theory to explain the diﬀerent results. First, there is a striking diﬀerence in the leadership of the two governments and the way they organized for the planning. The Norwegian government led the process in a top-down manner and tried to apply a “whole-of-government” approach. The Canadian government delegated the entire task to the regional branches of one ministry alone. The diﬀerent roles taken may be explained by diﬀerent political and economic contexts that create diﬀerent motivations for the governments to engage. Second, there were diﬀerent ways of deciding when conﬂicts arose. The Norwegian coalition government negotiated internal compromises in the form of package deals. In Canada, the collaborative planning based on consensus concealed disagreements in high-level statements and pushed concrete solutions forward to later action planning that never occurred. These processes reﬂect diﬀerent national policy styles and resulted in policy designs that created a very diﬀerent impetus for implementation. The analysis demonstrate how theory-driven case-study methodology can lead to cumulative results.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem management is managing areas at various scales in such a way that ecological services and biological resources are conserved while appropriate human uses are sustained. Major ecological services include allocation of productivity Ženergy flow., maintenance of soil fertility Žnutrient cycling., and operation of the hydrologic cycle. Biological resources encompass all natural variation found in genes, species, and communities along with the processes that maintain this variation. The appropriateness and sustainability of human uses are dictated by the constraints imposed by the biological and physical environment and by legal mandates for land use. There are seven critical steps in ecosystem management. These are: Ž1. delineate Ždefine. the ecosystem to be managed; Ž2. define strategic management goals; Ž3. develop a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem; Ž4. obtain socioeconomic data; Ž5. link the socioeconomic and ecological data in an appropriate model; Ž6. implement experimental management actions; and Ž7. monitor management results to determine long-term success or failure. The significance of ecosystem management is that it focuses on ecological systems as a whole rather than on just some of their parts, includes public involvement in the goal-setting process, integrates conservation into economic activity, and represents a paradigm shift from ‘linear comprehensive’ management to ‘cyclic-incremental’ or ‘adaptive’ management. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Pushed by recognition of the problems of fragmented management and growing interest in synthetic management goals such as sustainable development, biodiversity and ecosystem integrity, ecosystem-based management is of growing intellectual and practical significance in North America and elsewhere. Ecosystem-based management has several roots: the ecosystem approaches developed in several disciplines in the 1960s and 1970s, and earlier; more general systems approaches; and regional, bioregional, watershed and integrated resource management approaches. Although building on these, ecosystem-based management is a distinct activity that also draws on and complements ecosystem science, conservation biology, and environmental planning. Ecosystem-based management seeks to transcend arbitrary political and administrative boundaries, to achieve more effective, integrated management of resources and ecosystems at regional and landscape scales. Several key components of ecosystem-based management can be identified: defining the management unit, developing understanding, and creating planning and management frameworks. This paper draws on case studies of progress toward ecosystem-based management in Canada, the USA, and Australia to highlight lessons for implementing ecosystembased management, and the need for new goals for it, in order to foster further, future development. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem management is widely proposed in the popular and professional literature as the modern and preferred way of managing natural resources and ecosystems. Advocates glowingly describe ecosystem management as an approach that will protect the environment, maintain healthy ecosystems, preserve biological diversity, and ensure sustainable development. Critics scoff at the concept as a new label for old ideas. The definitions of ecosystem management are vague and clarify little. Seven core principles, or pillars, of ecosystem management define and bound the concept and provide operational meaning: Ž1. ecosystem management reflects a stage in the continuing evolution of social values and priorities; it is neither a beginning nor an end; Ž2. ecosystem management is place-based and the boundaries of the place must be clearly and formally defined; Ž3. ecosystem management should maintain ecosystems in the appropriate condition to achieve desired social benefits; Ž4. ecosystem management should take advantage of the ability of ecosystems to respond to a variety of stressors, natural and man-made, but all ecosystems have limited ability to accommodate stressors and maintain a desired state; Ž5. ecosystem management may or may not result in emphasis on biological diversity; Ž6. the term sustainability, if used at all in ecosystem management, should be clearly defined—specifically, the time frame of concern, the benefits and costs of concern, and the relative priority of the benefits and costs; and Ž7. scientific information is important for effective ecosystem management, but is only one element in a decision-making process that is fundamentally one of public and private choice. A definition of ecosystem management based on the seven pillars is: ‘the application of ecological and social information, options, and constraints to achieve desired social benefits within a defined geographic area and over a specified period’. As with all management paradigms, there is no ‘right’ decision but rather those decisions that appear to best respond to society’s current and future needs as expressed through a decision-making process. There are, however, wrong management decisions, including the decision not to make a decision. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {The debate over the objectives and methods of ecosystem management has been confusing, in part because people truly mean different things when they use the term ecosystem management. These different meanings reflect differences in interests, values, and knowledge. I organized these meanings into three sets: “environmentally sensitive multiple use,” an “ecosystem approach to resource management,” and “ecoregional management.” Environmentally sensitive multiple use takes an anthropocentric perspective that seeks to foster multiple human uses subject to an understanding of environmental constraints that goes beyond that considered in traditional multiple-use management. An ecosystem approach incorporates a biocentric view in which ecosystems are understood as a metaphor for holistic thinking requiring an expanded consideration of the dynamism and complexity of ecological systems, scale phenomena, and the need for management across ownership boundaries. Ecoregional management takes an ecocentric perspective that focuses on the management of specific landscape ecosystems defined as real geographic spaces and that shifts management focus toward ecosystem processes and away from biota. Understanding these three conceptualizations as different points along a continuum of resource management paradigms helps clarify the different visions of ecosystem management held by different groups. Because different places and groups are at various points on the continuum, progress comes from moving along the continuum and not necessarily by seeking a single state called “ecosystem management.” Policy prescriptions, such as changes in law, incentives, and information provision, can be targeted more effectively to the realities of different settings. Ultimately, the conceptualization suggests that heterogeneity of ecosystem management approaches is desirable, as long as we learn from the diverse experiences that result.},

	abstract = {Ecological stability is touted as a complex and multifaceted concept, including components such as variability, resistance, resilience, persistence and robustness. Even though a complete appreciation of the effects of perturbations on ecosystems requires the simultaneous measurement of these multiple components of stability, most ecological research has focused on one or a few of those components analysed in isolation. Here, we present a new view of ecological stability that recognises explicitly the non-independence of components of stability. This provides an approach for simplifying the concept of stability. We illustrate the concept and approach using results from a ﬁeld experiment, and show that the effective dimensionality of ecological stability is considerably lower than if the various components of stability were unrelated. However, strong perturbations can modify, and even decouple, relationships among individual components of stability. Thus, perturbations not only increase the dimensionality of stability but they can also alter the relationships among components of stability in different ways. Studies that focus on single forms of stability in isolation therefore risk underestimating signiﬁcantly the potential of perturbations to destabilise ecosystems. In contrast, application of the multidimensional stability framework that we propose gives a far richer understanding of how communities respond to perturbations.},

	abstract = {Regime shifts are substantial, long-lasting reorganizations of complex systems, such as ecosystems. Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts among vegetation types, degradation of coral reefs and regional climate change often come as surprises because we lack leading indicators for regime shifts. Increases in variability of ecosystems have been suggested to foreshadow ecological regime shifts. However, it may be difﬁcult to discern variability due to impending regime shift from that of exogenous drivers that affect the ecosystem. We addressed this problem using a model of lake eutrophication. Lakes are subject to ﬂuctuations in recycling associated with regime shifts, as well as ﬂuctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation (SD) could signal impending shifts about a decade in advance. The rising SD was detected by studying variability around predictions of a simple time-series model, and did not depend on detailed knowledge of the actual ecosystem dynamics.},

Recent modelling and conceptual work suggests that stability is a multidimensional construct comprising different response aspects. Using two freshwater mesocosm experiments as case studies, we show how the response to single perturbations can be decomposed in different stability aspects (resistance, resilience, recovery, temporal stability) for both ecosystem functions and community composition. We ﬁnd that extended community recovery is tightly connected to a nearly complete recovery of the function (biomass production), whereas systems with incomplete recovery of the species composition ranged widely in their biomass compared to controls. Moreover, recovery was most complete when either resistance or resilience was high, the latter associated with low temporal stability around the recovery trend. In summary, no single aspect of stability was sufﬁcient to reﬂect the overall stability of the system.},

Although Lyapunov stability adequately characterizes perturbation responses of systems typically studied in physics, it does not for ecological systems. This failure reveals a limitation of its underlying mathematical theory, and an important difference between dynamic systems modeling in physics and biology.},

	abstract = {The concepts of ecological stability, instability, and lability are discussed and defined; they should be used only as general concepts. Ecological stability is the continued existence of an ecological system or its capability to restore the original state after a change. It is important to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic stability and instability. According to the presence or absence of disturbance factors (extraordinary factors) and the amplitude of the oscillations of the parameters under consideration the following types of ecological stability can be distinguished: constancy, cyclicity, resistance, and elasticity. For every investigation of stability special criteria and scales of observation must be elaborated. Based on the example of plant communities of the Alps general conclusions are drawn: (1) no ecological system is stable in respect to all possible disturbance factors; (2) different types of stability can occur within the same ecological system; (3) the same disturbance factor can have completely different effects in very similar ecological systems; (4) depending on the criteria and scales of observation the same ecological phenomenon can be considered stable or unstable and evaluated negatively or positively. Thus statements about stability are only of limited value unless it is clearly specified which criteria and scales of observation are used, which disturbance factor is being considered, and which type of stability is occurring. A list of principles contributing to ecological stability is presented; it can be used as a checklist for assessing the risk of instability.},

There is, however, an urgent need to extend existing knowledge to larger spatial scales to match the scale of management and conservation. Here, we develop a general theoretical framework to study the stability and variability of ecosystems at multiple scales. Analogously to the partitioning of biodiversity, we propose the concepts of alpha, beta and gamma variability. Gamma variability at regional (metacommunity) scale can be partitioned into local alpha variability and spatial beta variability, either multiplicatively or additively. On average, variability decreases from local to regional scales, which creates a negative variability–area relationship. Our partitioning framework suggests that mechanisms of regional ecosystem stability can be understood by investigating the inﬂuence of ecological factors on alpha and beta variability. Diversity can provide insurance effects at the various levels of variability, thus generating alpha, beta and gamma diversity–stability relationships. As a consequence, the loss of biodiversity and habitat impairs ecosystem stability at the regional scale. Overall, our framework enables a synthetic understanding of ecosystem stability at multiple scales and has practical implications for landscape management.},

Here, we assess the potential beneﬁts and challenges of applying an Ecosystem Approach to management using one particular method, the Holistic Ecosystem Health Indicator (HEHI), which integrates data from the ecological, social and interactive dimensions into a single composite index of ecosystem ‘health’. We apply it to one of the best-documented catchments in the UK, the Ythan Estuary in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, based on a 50-year time series of data. The evaluation of ecosystem health over time is lacking in previous applications of HEHI, yet is crucial for the assessment of the utility of this approach to ecosystem management.},

The most frequently used estimate of resilience is based on the eigenvalues of the system at its equilibrium. In most cases, this estimate describes the rate of recovery only asymptotically, as time goes to inﬁnity. However, in the short term, perturbations can grow signiﬁcantly before they decay, and eigenvalues provide no information about this transient behavior. We present several new measures of transient response that complement resilience as a description of the response to perturbation. These indices measure the extent and duration of transient growth in models with asymptotically stable equilibria. They are the reactivity (the maximum possible growth rate immediately following the perturbation), the maximum ampliﬁcation (the largest proportional deviation that can be produced by any perturbation), and the time at which this ampliﬁcation occurs. We demonstrate the calculation of these indices using previously published linear compartment models (two models for phosphorus cycling through a lake ecosystem and one for the ﬂow of elements through a tropical rain forest) and a standard nonlinear predator–prey model. Each of these models exhibits transient growth of perturbations, despite asymptotic stability. Measures of relative stability that ignore transient growth will often give a misleading picture of the response to a perturbation. Key words: compartment models; eigenvalues; pulse perturbations; reactivity; relative stability; resilience; return time; transient vs. asymptotic dynamics.},

Three related attributes of social–ecological systems (SESs) determine their future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components—latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy—most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES, essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which this can be done, corresponding to the four aspects of resilience. Transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic, or social structures make the existing system untenable.},

Even though increased conceptual vagueness can be valuable to foster communication across disciplines and between science and practice, both conceptual clarity and practical relevance of the concept of resilience are critically in danger. The fundamental question is what conceptual structure we want resilience to have.

Aﬀordance is deﬁned as a function provided by an object through an interaction with a user. We ﬁrst present a conceptual framework to assess the aﬀordances of SA tools. This framework is then applied in a literature review of three SA tools used in agricultural systems research (fuzzy cognitive mapping, bio-economic whole-farm models, and role play and serious games). Through this exercise, we extend the SA tool design and implementation dialogue by illuminating (i) links between lower-level affordances, tool design, and heuristic functioning, and (ii) the central role of use setting and facilitation in mobilizing higher-level, productive aﬀordances. Based on our ﬁndings, we make ﬁve propositions for how SA tool design and implementation in participatory problem-solving settings can be improved.},

	abstract = {Resilience is often considered a precondition for sustainable social-ecological systems. But how can this understanding of resilience be applied to food systems? We operationalized the concept by subdividing it into diﬀerent resilience dimensions, namely: buﬀer capacity, self-organization, and capacity for learning and adaptation. Speciﬁc indicators were deﬁned for each dimension: (1) agrobiodiversity and livelihood assets for buﬀer capacity; (2) decentralization and independence, local consumption of production, interest groups, ecological self-regulation, and connectivity for self-organization; and (3) knowledge of threats and opportunities, reﬂective and shared learning, feedback mechanisms, existence and use of local-traditional knowledge, and a shared food system vision for capacity for learning and adaptation. Next, we applied the resilience indicators to diﬀerent food systems (agroindustrial, local, and agroecological) in Kenya and Bolivia, including assessment of the interaction and coexistence of food systems. While the contexts in the two countries diﬀer greatly, we identiﬁed several common trends that appear to be undermining food system resilience in both settings. These trends include low ecological buﬀer capacity and self-regulation in agroindustrial food systems; strong disparities in income and access to productive resources; competition for water, land, and labor; exclusion from markets; and low human capital and feedback mechanisms in locally based, traditional food systems. Taken together, these trends cast doubt on food system coexistence narratives. Finally, the results enable us to identify leverage points in the food systems – e.g., regarding learning and feedback mechanisms – that could be used to foster food system transformations linked to goals of sustainability and justice.},

For example, current intensiﬁed production systems lead to undernutrition in some regions coupled with epidemics of obesity in others while compromising their underlying ecological foundations, such as creating areas of ocean hypoxia. Such common observations challenge the research community to ask new types of basic questions and apply novel analytical frameworks for analyzing them. Elaboration of an integrated applied research agenda is imperative to addressing these global food system challenges. We propose that core competencies of a new analytical framework lie at the intersection of four domains: (1) the ecology of agroecosystems; (2) equity in global and local food systems; (3) cultural dimensions of food and agriculture; and (4) human health. This intersection constitutes a new analytical framework for transitions toward global food system sustainability.},

	abstract = {Several important morphogenetic processes belong to the category of collective cell movements (CCM), by which we mean coordinated rearrangements of many neighboring cells. The causes of the dynamic order established during CCM are still unclear. We performed statistical studies of rates and angular orientations of cell rearrangements in two kinds of embryonic tissues, which we categorized as “committed” (in the sense of being capable of autonomous CCM) as opposed to “naïve” tissues, which are those that require external forces in order to exhibit full scale CCM. In addition, we distinguished two types of cell rearrangements: first, those in which mutual cell-cell shifts characterizing the local dynamics (LD); and, second, those which moved in reference to common external coordinates (global dynamics, GD). We observed that in most cases LD rates deviated from normal distributions and do so by creating excesses of extensively converging and moderately diverging cells. In contrast, GD was characterized by nearly random behavior of slowly moving cells, combined with increased angular focusing of the fast cells trajectories as well as bimodal distribution of cell rates. When committed tissues were opposed by external mechanical forces, then they tended to preserve the inherent CCM patterns. On the other hand, the naïve ones reacted by creating two orthogonal cells flows, one of these coinciding with the force direction. We consider CCM as a self-organizing process based on feedbacks between converging and diverging cell shifts, which is able to focus the trajectories imposed by external forces.},

	abstract = {We describe an iterated game between two players, in which the payoff is to survive a number of steps. Expected payoffs are probabilities of survival. A key feature of the game is that individuals have to survive on their own if their partner dies. We consider individuals with hardwired, unconditional behaviors or strategies. When both players are present, each step is a symmetric two-player game. The overall survival of the two individuals forms a Markov chain. As the number of iterations tends to infinity, all probabilities of survival decrease to zero. We obtain general, analytical results for n-step payoffs and use these to describe how the game changes as n increases. In order to predict changes in the frequency of a cooperative strategy over time, we embed the survival game in three different models of a large, wellmixed population. Two of these models are deterministic and one is stochastic. Offspring receive their parent’s type without modification and fitnesses are determined by the game. Increasing the number of iterations changes the prospects for cooperation. All models become neutral in the limit (n → ∞). Further, if pairs of cooperative individuals survive together with high probability, specifically higher than for any other pair and for either type when it is alone, then cooperation becomes favored if the number of iterations is large enough. This holds regardless of the structure of pairwise interactions in a single step. Even if the single-step interaction is a Prisoner’s Dilemma, the cooperative type becomes favored. Enhanced survival is crucial in these iterated evolutionary games: if players in pairs start the game with a fitness deficit relative to lone individuals, the prospects for cooperation can become even worse than in the case of a single-step game.},

When applied to (protein) reaction networks however, those conditions do not provide information since they are trivially satisﬁed as soon as there is a bimolecular or a reversible reaction. Reﬁned graphical requirements have been proposed to deal with such cases. In this paper, we present for the ﬁrst time a graph rewriting algorithm for checking the reﬁned conditions given by Soliman, and evaluate its practical performance by applying it systematically to the curated branch of the BioModels repository. This algorithm analyzes all reaction networks (of size up to 430 species) in less than 0.05 second per network, and permits to conclude to the absence of multistationarity in 160 networks over 506. The short computation times obtained in this graphical approach are in sharp contrast to the Jacobian-based symbolic computation approach. We also discuss the case of one extra graphical condition by arc rewiring that allows us to conclude on 20 more networks of this benchmark but with a high computational cost. Finally, we study with some details the case of phosphorylation cycles and MAPK signalling models which show the importance of modelling the intermediate complexations with the enzymes in order to correctly analyze the multistationarity capabilities of such biochemical reaction networks.},

	abstract = {Through the lens of game theory, cooperation is frequently considered an unsustainable strategy: if an entire population is cooperating, each individual can increase its overall fitness by choosing not to cooperate, thereby still receiving all the benefit of its cooperating neighbors while no longer expending its own energy. Observable cooperation in naturally-occurring public goods games is consequently of great interest, as such systems offer insight into both the emergence and sustainability of cooperation. Here we consider a population that obeys a public goods game on a network of discrete regions (that we call colonies), between any two of which individuals are free to migrate. We construct a system of piecewise-smooth ordinary differential equations that couple the within-colony population dynamics and the between-colony migratory dynamics. Through a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show that if the workers within the population migrate sufficiently fast relative to the cheaters, the network loses stability first through a Hopf bifurcation, then a torus bifurcation, after which one or more colonies collapse. Our results indicate that fast moving cheaters can act to stabilize worker–cheater coexistence within network that would otherwise collapse. We end with a comparison of our results with the dynamics observed in colonies of the ant species Pristomyrmex punctatus, and argue that they qualitatively agree.},

It is shown that a variety of patterns are possible based on the intensity of efforts distributed among different trophic levels. Thus we may suggest that ﬁshing down the food chain, as suggested by Pauly et al. (1998) is not bound to happen. Our analysis also shows that balancing the harvest between prey, intermediate predator and top predator could give more yield and stabilizing the ecosystem, than the selective harvesting of any one species. This balanced harvesting may not be a win–win situation for yield and resilience, but it could be a most favourable strategy to balance them. This research would help to correlate resilience with yield and determines the desirable selection of two policies, resilience maximizing yield or maximum sustainable yield to safeguard ecological communities.},

The model can be useful for engineers, researchers and, in general, decision makers in the energy policy ﬁeld. With the exception of biomass fuels, the results obtained reinforce the idea that renewable energies make a greater contribution to sustainable development than their conventional counterparts. Renewable energies have a sustainability index that varies between 0.39 and 0.80; 0 and 1 being the lowest and highest contribution to sustainability, respectively. On the other hand, conventional power plants obtained results that fall between 0.29 and 0.57.

Numerous sustainability assessment methods meet this requirement, but most of them handle only one type of production system (arable crops, fruit or vegetables). We propose here a common framework for sustainability assessment applicable to various types of crop production. The DEXiPM model, which was designed for the ex ante assessment of innovative arable CS was adapted to other production systems. Three groups of experts analyzed and modiﬁed this model, to develop suitable methods for assessing the sustainability of pomefruit orchards, ﬁeld vegetable systems, and grapevine systems. We used the resulting models to formalize a sustainability assessment framework, in which a ﬁxed core of hierarchically organized generic agricultural sustainability issues can be weighted according to stakeholder priorities, and a set of basic attributes can be estimated in a ﬂexible manner, depending on the situation to be assessed and the data available. This common framework for sustainability assessment has several advantages. It can facilitate communication between stakeholders involved in the development of innovative production systems. It can also help researchers to identify gaps in knowledge and the means of bridging them. Its results can provide recommendations for policy makers, concerning actions likely to incite the adoption of innovative systems, for example. We also consider the general applicability and limitations of this framework.},

In this case study, we employed a multidisciplinary methodology for exploring agroecosystem sustainability by using eddy covariance (EC) data to compute thermodynamic entropy production ( ) and relate it to water, energy and carbon cycling in croplands and grasslands of the Central US. From 2002 to 2012, the biophysical metric of was compared across AmeriFlux sites, each with site-speciﬁc land management practices of irrigation, crop rotation, and tillage. Results show that is most correlated with net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon, and when cropland and grassland sites are close to being carbon neutral, values range from 0.51–1.0 W K−1 m−2 for grasslands, 0.81–1.0 W K−1 m−2 for rainfed croplands, and 0.81–1.1 W K−1 m−2 for irrigated croplands. Irrigated maize stressed by hydrologic and high temperature anomalies associated with the 2012 drought exhibit the greatest increase in , indicating the possibility of decreased sustainability compared to rainfed croplands and grasslands. These results suggest that maximizing carbon uptake with irrigation and fertilizer use tends to move agroecosystems further away from thermodynamic equilibrium, which has implications for ecological sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in climate-smart agriculture. The underlying theoretical concepts, multidisciplinary methodology, and use of eddy covariance data for biophysical indicators in this study contribute to a unique understanding of ecological sustainability in agricultural systems.},

	abstract = {There are inherent social, environmental, and economic trade-oﬀs in agricultural systems, which by deﬁnition have been altered from their natural state by humans for food and ﬁbre production. Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental and social impacts of agriculture, and with the increasing inﬂuence of social media, agribusinesses and industries can be held accountable for their actions in the public domain. Thus, environmental sustainability reporting is increasingly being viewed as a cost of doing business in agriculture. There are a number of approaches used to measure agroecosystem health (AEH) around the world, but they are generally designed to make comparisons at coarse spatial scales (i.e. nations) or report on speciﬁc management actions implemented at the local scale (i.e. farm, catchment, or sub-region). Here we present a simple, yet scientiﬁcally robust assessment framework that can be used to benchmark and monitor the speciﬁc impacts of agricultural management practices on the environment. The general principles are drawn from environmental monitoring and experiences gained in environmental assessments that are not necessarily agriculturally focussed. However, many commonly used environmental indicators are not suitable for AEH assessment because they do not explicitly link environmental outcomes to management actions; or they fail to separate speciﬁc agricultural impacts from broader cumulative impacts resulting from other industries or land uses. We recommend using a combination of diagnostic, outcome-based indicators, in addition to practice- and product-based measures to communicate eﬀorts to improve agroecosystem health outcomes. The framework presented here enables assessments at local scales, but can be aggregated or disaggregated to report at ﬁner or coarser scales. This ﬂexibility ensures that the assessment is relevant to the proponent and stakeholders, while also providing a way to make comparisons between producers, industries, or regions as part of an adaptive monitoring and assessment framework. This also opens the door for industry-based AEH monitoring program to provide, or make use of information from government-funded environmental monitoring programs, with beneﬁts to both.},

	abstract = {Agroecosystems are on both the receiving and contributing ends of increasingly demanding climatic and environmental conditions. Maintaining productive systems under resource scarcity and multiplicative stresses requires precise monitoring and systems-scale planning. By incorporating ecological resilience into agroecosystems research we can gain valuable insight into agroecosystem identity, change, responsivity, and performance under stress, but only if we move away from resilience as a mere touchstone concept. Using the productivity, stability, resistance, and recovery of system processes as a basic framework for resilience monitoring, we propose quantitative research approaches to tackle the continuing lack of biophysical, ﬁeld-scale indicators needed to lend insight into dynamic resilience variables and mechanisms. We emphasize the importance of considering productive functions, sources of system regulation and disturbance, and cross-scale interactions when applying resilience theory to agroecosystems. Agroecosystem resilience research requires understanding of multiple scales and speeds of inﬂuence both above and below the focal scale. When these considerations are addressed, resilience theory can add tangible value to agroecosystems research, both for the purposes of monitoring current systems and of planning future systems that can reconcile productivity and sustainability goals.},

	abstract = {Well-designed and supported innovation niches may facilitate transitions towards sustainable agricultural futures, which may follow diﬀerent approaches and paradigms such as agroecology, local place-based food systems, vertical farming, bioeconomy, urban agriculture, and smart farming or digital farming. In this paper we consider how the existing agricultural innovation systems (AIS) approach might be opened up to better support the creation of innovation niches. We engage with Innovation Ecosystems thinking to consider the ways in which it might enhance eﬀorts to create multi-actor, cross-sectoral innovation niches that are capable of supporting transitions to sustainable agricultural systems across multiple scales. While sharing many similarities with AIS thinking, Innovation Ecosystems thinking has the potential to broaden AIS by: emphasizing the role of power in shaping directionality in innovation platforms or innovation communities that are connected to niches and their interaction with regimes; highlighting the plurality of actors and actants and the integral role of ecological actants in innovation; and oﬀering an umbrella concept through which to cross scalar and paradigmatic or sector boundaries in order to engage with a variety of innovation systems aﬀecting multifunctional agricultural landscapes and systems. To this end, an Agricultural Innovation Ecosystems approach may help design and support development of transboundary, inter-sectoral innovation niches that can realize more collective and integrated innovation in support of sustainability transitions, and help enact mission oriented agricultural innovation policy.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems (RAAIS). RAAIS is a diagnostic tool that can guide the analysis of complex agricultural problems and innovation capacity of the agricultural system in which the complex agricultural problem is embedded. RAAIS focuses on the integrated analysis of different dimensions of problems (e.g. biophysical, technological, socio-cultural, economic, institutional and political), interactions across different levels (e.g. national, regional, local), and the constraints and interests of different stakeholder groups (farmers, government, researchers, etc.). Innovation capacity in the agricultural system is studied by analysing (1) constraints within the institutional, sectoral and technological subsystems of the agricultural system, and (2) the existence and performance of the agricultural innovation support system. RAAIS combines multiple qualitative and quantitative methods, and insider (stakeholders) and outsider (researchers) analyses which allow for critical triangulation and validation of the gathered data. Such an analysis can provide speciﬁc entry points for innovations to address the complex agricultural problem under study, and generic entry points for innovation related to strengthening the innovation capacity of agricultural system and the functioning of the agricultural innovation support system. The application of RAAIS to analyse parasitic weed problems in the rice sector, conducted in Tanzania and Benin, demonstrates the potential of the diagnostic tool and provides recommendations for its further development and use.},

	abstract = {This article reports on the long-term involvement of research agronomists in a design process of agricultural systems in a water catchment area. While agriculture is facing increasing challenges to meet current societal expectations, several studies in agronomy have focused on the design processes that allow farmers to change their agricultural systems. Most of these processes have been dedicated to designing target agricultural systems but, more recently, several studies have acknowledged that agro-ecological practices replace farmers as the actual designers of their own production systems. In this context, how can agronomists support such design processes? How does a better understanding of these processes challenge the inputs that research agronomists can propose, to support them? We contribute to answering these questions by reviewing a case study of a design process supported and analyzed by research agronomists over several years. This case illustrates that the design of agricultural systems is a process that exceeds invention: the implementation of the initial design solutions produces information that should be used to review those same solutions, in order to reach the design goal. The case study shows that the design process depends on a tension between the exploration of an ambitious desirable future and its actual implementation. To foster dialogue between “desirable” and “actual”, we show how the researchers involved in this case provided a range of inputs that supported typical design activities (grounding, fostering design reasoning, reinterpreting this reasoning, and design strategy throughout the process), thus opening new avenues of research in agronomy.},

	abstract = {Agroecology is a new paradigm whose aim is to redesign farming systems. The implementation of its principles engages farmers in a radical transformation of their practices, their way of reasoning and their participation in local knowledge production and innovation processes. Acknowledgement of this transformation now frequently leads researchers to invite farmers and other stakeholders to participate in research projects on the design of innovative farming systems. However, the objective of their involvement and the role farmers play in such projects is rarely made explicit and can range from simple knowledge providers to co-designers. Here we review the role of farmers and other stakeholders in such participatory research projects, and its impact on their learning and engagement in the local transformation of farming systems. Using a framework based on design theories, we analyzed thirty-nine papers on the design of innovative farming systems in which farmers and other stakeholders were involved. We identiﬁed ﬁve main co-design approaches to the design of agroecological farming systems: “De-novo design”, “Case-study design”, “Niche innovation design”, “Co-innovation”, and “Activity centered design”. Despite this diversity, if researchers aim to promote the development of agroecology, there a still need to better link researcher-oriented approaches and support-oriented approaches, to design local set-ups that will help farmers and other stakeholders in the long term process of redesigning farming systems. In terms of design methodologies, this means sharing project leadership with farmers and organizing co-design locally to better bridge the gap between thinking and doing. This means better accounting for the singularities of farmers' situations and of the local activity system to be transformed. This paper should help researchers choose their participatory methodologies better with respect to both to their transformational and scientiﬁc goals, when organizing participatory projects to support the development of agroecological farming systems.},

	abstract = {When they re-design their cropping systems to move towards agroecology, farmers implement practices that involve biological processes. Such practices have been qualiﬁed as knowledge-intensive, as they involve the renewal of agronomic principles and numerous interactions between the systems’ components and their regulation. Several studies recognize the value of discussing knowledge on systems’ functioning and component properties with farmers, in relation to technical change processes. This paper investigates some processes of coordination of fundamental and generic knowledge on biological processes, on the situated knowledge that farmers may use when introducing technical changes in their own cropping system, and on the integrated approach to agroecological processes. We perform an inductive inquiry, in the framework of an iterative and instrumental analysis of case studies. We chose ﬁve cases of different step-by-step cropping system re-design situations. Through our crosscutting analysis, we highlight the fundamental knowledge on biological objects that the farmers mobilized, and we describe some aspects of the processes involved in its contextualization. In particular, we describe four patterns of connection between fundamental knowledge and farmers’ actions, and distinguish three main reformulations of fundamental knowledge that participate in contextualizing it. These involve reinterpretation of individual experiences and identiﬁcation of the effects of action on the situated biological processes. We conclude on research orientations for considering expert knowledge not as a speciﬁc content to integrate, but as a situated way of knowing that should be acknowledged in its processes.},

However, while the term has been heavily theorised and discussed, particularly in the natural and environmental sciences, it is sufﬁciently ambiguous to support divergent and even contradictory policy goals and farmers' strategies. This paper focuses on the more encompassing notion of social-ecological resilience and contends that among the causes of this divergence are the disparate spatial and temporal scales used to assess and plan enhancing resilience. Based on empirical evidence, we show that strategies that may increase farmers' abilities to persist in a difﬁcult economic environment may undermine the resilience of the wider region, while decisions that enhance farmers’ resilience in the short term may lock them onto a path that weakens their future resilience. Using case studies from 14 different countries across Europe and beyond, we address two main questions. Firstly, how the notion of resilience is being operationalised at a farm or regional level. That is to say, what are the different strategies that farmers, rural residents and other decision-makers in rural areas are using to enhance resilience? Secondly, we look at how the outcomes of implementing these strategies vary according to spatial and temporal factors.},

Elicitation of expert opinions combined with multi-criteria assessment (MCA) could be a useful approach for sustainability assessments in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, the validity of expert opinion used to score sustainability performance of agricultural systems, however, has not been addressed. Also, robustness of the overall outcome of MCA to uncertainty about scores obtained from expert elicitation and weights used to aggregate scores is generally not addressed. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the validity of expert opinion, and to evaluate the robustness of the overall MCA outcome to uncertainty about scores and weights. The case study considers three soybean agricultural systems in Latin America: conventional agricultural system, with either genetically modiﬁed (GM) or non-genetically modiﬁed (non-GM) soybeans, and organic agricultural system. The validation was carried out by comparing the sustainability scores of experts with values from scientiﬁc studies. The robustness of the overall outcome of the MCA to uncertainty about scores and weights was assessed using Monte Carlo simulation. The comparison of expert opinion with reviewed studies showed that expert opinions are a potential alternative to extensive data-rich methods. The validity of expert opinions can be increased by considering a larger group of experts, with a high level of knowledge about agricultural systems and sustainability issues. With regard to robustness, the overall outcome of the MCA showed higher variation for organic soybean agricultural systems compared with GM and non-GM, in both Brazil and Argentina.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a model for integrated sustainability assessment at a farm scale. The SOSTARE model (analysis of farm technical eﬃciency and impacts on environmental and economic sustainability), in fact, aims at providing a diagnostic tool to farmers and advisory services to assess the general performance of the farm, explore in detail any perceived weaknesses in farm management and to investigate the impact of changes that might improve eﬃciency. The model is derived from a survey of 68 farms. The sampled farms have been selected in order to represent the panorama of farm typologies that are characteristic of the agriculture in one of the most intensively cultivated areas of Europe, the Po plain in Northern Italy, and include multi-functional and non-multi-functional farms, low-input and conventional management typologies, subdivided into production of rice, cereals, and livestock (meat and milk). The SOSTARE model is based on a set of indicators, which are aggregated in a stepwise fashion to provide the user with an immediate valuation of a farm’s performance. The aggregation framework was structured on the following steps: statistical analysis of all the collected input data and indicators to identify relevant variables and reduce redundancy; identiﬁcation of the range of variation of the selected basic indicators and normalisation; deﬁnition of weights through statistical analysis and expert judgement, aggregation. The result is a synthetic indicator for each of the three analysed aspects of sustainability (economic, agronomic and ecological), which are decomposed into a total of twelve sub-dimensions. These include: fertilisers, water and agrochemical management; cropping system; energy input; value of production; value added; farm household income; CAP independence; farm business diversiﬁcation; natural value of the farm and functional landscape pattern. In practical terms the output of the model is provided to the user as original indicator values in the form of tables, bar diagrams corresponding to each aggregation step and a radar diagram representing the overall farm performance in the twelve sub-dimensions. Furthermore, results can be related either to the optimal performance or to a reference situation (i.e. the average of the farm typology, the average of all farms). Results show that the model is able to react to different types of farm management that were studied in the reference sample of farms and that weaknesses of farm performances can be clearly identiﬁed. Moreover, its application over time would provide information that could be used to assess and monitor policy performances at a regional level.},

This is a high priority given its importance for consumers, public policy and private industry. Data collection programmes will need to adapt their scope if their information is to adequately address new information needs about high-level objectives. Assessment of sustainability at the farm level is hindered by the lack of data with which to derive appropriate, meaningful, and relevant indicators. This is particularly problematic for assessment of agricultural sustainability across the European Union (EU). Various databases exist at the EU scale regarding agricultural data sources and we identify one of these, the EU Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), as having considerable potential to assess farm-level sustainability at EU level. We critique several examples of published work that has attempted to assess agricultural sustainability using: FADN data alone; FADN data in combination with data from supplementary surveys, and; FADN data in combination with data from other EU databases. We conclude that the FADN would need to broaden its scope of data collection if it is to address the new information needs of policy, and we discuss the challenges in expanding FADN with a view towards wider farm-level assessment of sustainability. These include careful selection of indicators based on various criteria, the representativeness of the FADN, and the need to include new themes to address environmental, social, and animal welfare eﬀects of policy.},

We propose a dynamical systems model that accounts for the state of the land, population and workers employed in swidden and intensive agriculture and monument building. Optimisation of model output to ﬁt empirical data ﬁxes biometric parameters to values consistent with the literature and requires that a shift from swidden to more intensive agriculture took place at around 550 CE. The latter prediction is consistent with the dating of the beginning of the Late Classical period. Thus, our model oﬀers an explanation of the collapse of the society of the Maya and suggests that the role of droughts may have been overestimated. Consistent with previous work, the collapse can be modelled by a critical transition (supercritical Hopf bifurcation), where the critical parameter is the harvesting rate per capita of intensive agriculture. Furthermore, an extensive sensitivity analysis indicates that the model and its predictions are robust.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the challenges of environmental change and the resource limitations experienced by modern society, recent decades have seen an increased interest in understanding the collapse of past societies. Modelling efforts so far have focused on single, isolated societies, while multi-patch dynamical models representing networks of coupled socio-environmental systems have received limited attention. We propose a model of societal evolution that describes the dynamics of a population that harvests renewable resources and manufactures products that have positive effects on population growth. Collapse is driven by a critical transition that occurs when the rate of natural resource extraction passes beyond a certain point, for which we present numerical and analytical results. Applying the model to Easter Island gives a good ﬁt to the archaeological record. Subsequently, we investigate what effects emerge from the movement of people, goods, and resources between two societies that share the characteristics of Easter Island. We analyse how diffusive coupling and wealth-driven coupling change the population levels and their distribution across the two societies compared to non-interacting societies. We ﬁnd that the region of parameter space in which societies can stably survive in the long-term is signiﬁcantly enlarged when coupling occurs in both social and environmental variables.},

Measuring progress towards sustainable or unsustainable urban development requires quantiﬁcation with the help of suitable sustainability indicators. There is a general ignorance about contextual meaning and understanding of the concept of sustainability which diﬀers from country to country and economic strata of the society. Our review aims to reduce this challenge by identifying major issues faced in the development and implementation of sustainability indicators in an urban context and suggesting remedial recommendations. We have identiﬁed two broad categories of challenges according to their development and implementation phase respectively, and three preliminary criteria in the application of urban sustainability indicators.},

In this study, we discuss the diﬀerence between urban resilience (UR) and urban sustainability (US) from three aspects of research trends, research scale and research clusters. CiteSpace 4.0.R5 is used for co-citation analysis, visualizing co-citation networks and research clusters. UR and US studies contrast in not only their diﬀerent theoretical bases, but also even more in their empirical work. A conceptual framework is proposed to deﬁne the diﬀerence between UR and US, and four kinds of urban development are examined based on the framework. We indicate that rational urban development can be achieved only when it is both resilient and sustainable, and conclude that urban planners, policymakers and researchers should pay equal attention to both UR and US before decision-making.},

The quest for a resilient behavior or a resilient answer, and the claim to improve urban and territorial resilience do not ﬁnd the same justiﬁcation in every kind of event; 2. Multiple sub meanings are embedded within one interpretation of resilience that leave the concept open to rather large margins of ambiguity, which emerge considering its operationalization; 3. The concept seems to ﬁt and to be appropriate within different paradigms, planning traditions and policy frameworks. Its alleged ‘neutrality’ is one of the main reasons of its pervasiveness, but also of its ambiguity, showing latent controversial implications, which are progressively emerging in critical planning theory.},

The frequency of recent incidents including natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and hurricanes, and also difficulties caused by the economic downturn has highlighted the vulnerability of human settlements and makes the appropriate consideration of resilience in the planning for future of urban areas of vital significance. Development of an assessment framework for evaluating the extent of resiliency of urban areas can be an effective way of incorporating resiliency-related issues into the urban planning process. For this purpose, it is necessary to clarify the implications of the resilience concept for the sustainability of urban areas. It is also important to identify resilience-related principles and criteria that should be embedded in the framework for assessing the resiliency of urban environments. This study involves an initial review of the literature on resilience and urban sustainability to extract a comprehensive set of criteria that can be used to develop an urban resilience assessment system. Moreover, it tries to design a conceptual framework, illustrative of the inter-relations between these various set of criteria. Criteria for assessment of the resilience of urban areas are divided into several main themes that cover environmental, economic, social, and institutional dimensions of sustainability. These themes would further be broken down into major criteria to account for important relevant areas such as land use, infrastructure, health, etc.},

However, these tools do not usually include evaluation of the performance measurement instrument itself. The main objective of this research is to develop a conceptual framework to design and assess the effectiveness of the sustainability indicators themselves. To put the proposed tool into practice, a set of key good-practice factors and meta-performance evaluation indicators is proposed for adoption in a national case study—the national sustainable development indicators system, SIDS Portugal, and the usefulness of this methodology is demonstrated. This approach aims to evaluate how appropriate a set of sustainability indicators is and allow an evaluation of overall performancemonitoring activities and results. Stakeholder involvement is an essential component of the proposed framework. The tool developed could support continuous improvement in the performance of ongoing sustainability indicator initiatives, allowing greater guidance, objectivity and transparency in sustainability assessment processes.},

In this paper, we hold a lens over key issues in transitioning to resilience in urban areas by outlining emerging challenges that may offer directions towards operationalising how cities might transition to a more resilient future, while ensuring that communities are at the center of the process. The emerging and challenging areas – geospatial ICT, green infrastructure planning, novel design using collaborative responses, climate planning, limiting urban sprawl and short-circuit economic approaches – are explored as viable facets for devising and sustaining urban transition strategies. We conclude with a discussion on the need for developing a synergistic approach in practice to facilitate transition.},

	abstract = {In ecological network theory, network efﬁciency and resilience are two essential but complementary attributes of the network structure, and a balance between these factors is critical for an ecosystem’s long-term sustainability. Our paper introduces this method and related concepts into water use systems to provide a new angle for sustainability quantiﬁcation. In this paper, we investigate the meanings of network efﬁciency and resilience in the context of sustainable development of water use systems, and deﬁne sustainable systems based on the optimal balance between network efﬁciency and resilience. With the consideration of complex artiﬁcial characteristics of water use, we propose an optimal water use network and quantify its ﬂows. By ascendency calculation, the balanced network structure can be determined. We then use the four sub-basins of China’s Haihe River as a case study to illustrate how the optimal network can be constructed and how the optimal balance for each scenario can be calculated. The results show that the optimal balance for the sub-basins has ascendency values ranging from 0.5970 to 0.7161. By analyzing the contribution of each water use activity to network’s balance structure, the location of the optimal balance in water use systems can be better understood. This research represents the ﬁrst attempt to explore the balance between a network structure’s efﬁciency and resilience as a way to quantify the sustainability of water use systems, and builds a foundation for future studies on the assessment, regulation, and management of water resources.},

In this paper urban sustainability is discussed in a whole system perspective using the ecosystem approach as a framework. This required that urban systems were described as ﬂow networks and investigated through ecological network analysis. Three cities are discussed as a case study and their network representation concerned water ﬂows that were identiﬁed knowing water exchanges between city components (i.e. sectors of human activity). Network analysis yielded system level indices that condense the complexity of the ﬂow structure (representing system’s metabolism) in a few measures that provide information on how systems grow and develop; as such they allow to explore sustainability at the whole system scale.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe an assessment of ecosystem health that is both comprehensive in that it is based on a series of common trends associated with the process of ecological succession, and operational in that the indices capable of quantifying these trends can be easily calculated given appropriate simulation model output or estimates of material exchange. We developed a simulation model which generated output characteristic of an ecosystem advancing through the various stages of succession to test the ability of a suite of systems-level information indices to quantify these trends. Our regression analyses suggest that these indices may be able to capture the trends associated with ecological succession, hence the reversal of many of these trends characteristic of ecosystem response to anthropogenic stress. We further argue that indice performance could be enhanced with the use of more dynamic modelling techniques. In addition, we introduce a methodology for the valuation of non-marketed ecosystem components which could be easily included with our assessment of ecosystem health. We conclude that this measure of ecosystem health in combination with the valuation technique may provide an informative compliment to many past and future regional modelling projects aimed at better understanding and managing the impacts of anthropogenic stress on our regional ecosystems. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although multiscale entropy has been applied to physiological time series, it measures irregularity as function of scale. In this study we purpose and evaluate a set of three complexity metrics as function of time scales. Complexity metrics are derived from nonadditive entropy supported by generation of surrogate data, i.e. SDiffqmax , qmax and qzero. In order to access accuracy of proposed complexity metrics, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were built and area under the curves was computed for three physiological situations. Heart rate variability (HRV) time series in normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure data set were analyzed. Results show that proposed metric for complexity is accurate and robust when compared to classic entropic irregularity metrics. Furthermore, SDiffqmax is the most accurate for lower scales, whereas qmax and qzero are the most accurate when higher time scales are considered. Multiscale complexity analysis described here showed potential to assess complex physiological time series and deserves further investigation in wide context.},

	abstract = {Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has been described as a disorder where frequent lapses of attention impair the ability of an individual to focus/attend in a sustained manner, thereby generating abnormally large intra-individual behavioral variability across trials. Indeed, increased reaction time (RT) variability is a fundamental behavioral characteristic of individuals with ADHD found across a large number of cognitive tasks. But what is the underlying neurophysiology that might generate such behavioral instability? Here, we examined trial-by-trial EEG response variability to visual and auditory stimuli while subjects' attention was diverted to an unrelated task at the ﬁxation cross. Comparisons between adult ADHD and control participants revealed that neural response variability was signiﬁcantly larger in the ADHD group as compared with the control group in both sensory modalities. Importantly, larger trial-by-trial variability in ADHD was apparent before and after stimulus presentation as well as in trials where the stimulus was omitted, suggesting that ongoing (rather than stimulus-evoked) neural activity is continuously more variable (noisier) in ADHD. While the patho-physiological mechanisms causing this increased neural variability remain unknown, they appear to act continuously rather than being tied to a speciﬁc sensory or cognitive process.},

The present study compares the reliability of a number of metrics for higher moments of the reaction time distribution on a battery of speeded tasks, and supplements these analyses with a Monte Carlo analysis of the go no-go task. The reliability of ISV is shown to be dependent on both the metric used and the number of trials used to calculate them. However, when using sufﬁcient trials and appropriate metrics, ISV shows good test–retest and odd–even reliability. This study has important practical implications for the design and analysis of studies into ISV, as well as theoretical importance for the trait concept of ISV.},

Two methods of preprocessing were used: the convolution of inverse interval function values with a rectangular window and the cubic polynomial interpolation. The HRV time series were obtained from 33 Wistar rats submitted to autonomic blockade protocols and from 17 healthy adults. The analysis of determinism was carried out by the method of surrogate data sets and nonlinear autoregressive moving average modelling and prediction. The scaling exponents , 1 and 2 derived from the detrended uctuation analysis were calculated from raw HRV time series and respective preprocessed signals. It was shown that the technique of cubic interpolation of HRV time series did not signiÿcantly change any nonlinear characteristic studied in this work, while the method of convolution only a ected the 1 index.

	abstract = {Objective. To investigate the nature of variability present in time series generated from gait parameters of two diﬀerent age groups via a nonlinear analysis. Design. Measures of nonlinear dynamics were used to compare kinematic parameters between elderly and young females.
Background. Aging may lead to changes in motor variability during walking, which may explain the large incidence of falls in the elderly.
Methods. Twenty females, 10 younger (20–37 yr) and 10 older (71–79 yr) walked on a treadmill for 30 consecutive gait cycles. Time series from selected kinematic parameters of the right lower extremity were analyzed using nonlinear dynamics. The largest Lyapunov exponent and the correlation dimension of all time series, and the largest Lyapunov exponent of the original time series surrogated were calculated. Standard deviations and coeﬃcient of variations were also calculated for selected discrete points from each gait cycle. Independent t-tests were used for statistical comparisons.
Results. The Lyapunov exponents were found to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from their surrogate counterparts. This indicates that the ﬂuctuations observed in the time series may reﬂect deterministic processes by the neuromuscular system. The elderly exhibited signiﬁcantly larger Lyapunov exponents and correlation dimensions for all parameters evaluated indicating local instability. The linear measures indicated that the elderly demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher variability.
Conclusions. The nonlinear analysis revealed that ﬂuctuations in the time series of certain gait parameters are not random but display a deterministic behavior. This behavior may degrade with physiologic aging resulting in local instability.},

	title = {Review: {Population} {Variability} and {Extinction} {Risk}},
	abstract = {Population models generally predict increased extinction risk (ER) with increased population variability (PV), yet some empirical tests have provided contradictory findings. Weresolve this conflict by attributing negative measured relationships to a statistical artifact that arises because PV tends to be underestimnated for populations with short persistence. Such populations do not go extinct quickly as a consequence of low intrinsic variability; instead, the measured variability is low because they go extinct so quickly. Consequently, any underlying positive relationship between PV and ER tends to be obscured. We conducted a series of analyses to evaluate this claim. Simulations showed that negative measured relationships are to be expected, despite an underlying positive relationship. Simulations also identified properties of data, minimizing this bias and thereby permitting meaningful analysis. Experimental data on laboratory populations of a bruchid beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus) supported the simulation results. Likewise, with an appropriate statistical approach (Cox regression on untransformed data), reanalysis of a controversial data set on British island bird populations revealed a significant positive association between PV and ER (p = 0.03). Finally, a similar analysis of time series for naturally regulated animal populations revealed a positive association between PV and quasiextinction risk (p {\textless} 0.01). Without exception, our simulation results, experimental findings, reanalysis of published data, and analysis of quasiextinction risk all contradict previous reports of negative or equivocal relationships. Valid analysis of meaningful data provides strong evidence that increased population variability leads to increased extinction risk.},

	abstract = {Extinction is rarely random across ecological and geological time scales. Traits that make some species more extinction-prone include individual traits, such as body size, and abundance. Substantial consistency appears across ecological and geological time scales in such traits. Evolutionary branching produces phylogenetic (as often measured by taxonomic) nesting of extinction-biasing traits at many scales. An example is the tendency, seen in both fossil and modern data, for higher taxa living in marine habitats to have generally lower species extinction rates. At lower taxononomic levels, recent bird and mammal extinctions are concentrated in certain genera and families. A fundamental result of such selectivity is that it can accelerate net loss of biodiversity compared to random loss of species among taxa. Replacement of vulnerable taxa by rapidly spreading taxa that thrive in human-altered environments will ultimately produce a spatially more homogenized biosphere with much lower net diversity.},

	abstract = {We investigate relationships between life history traits and the character of population dynamics as revealed by time series data. Our classification of time series is according to `extinction category,' where we identify three classes of populations: (i) weakly varying populations with such high growth rates that long-term persistence is likely (unless some extreme catastrophe occurs); (ii) populations with such low growth rates that average population size must be large to buffer them against extinction in a variable environment; and (iii) highly variable populations that fluctuate so dramatically that dispersal or some other refuge mechanism is likely to be key to their avoidance of extinction. Using 1941 time series representing 758 species from the Global Population Dynamics Database, we find that, depending on the form of density dependence one assumes, between 46 and 90\% of species exhibit dynamics that are so variable that even large carrying capacities could not buffer them against extinction on a 100-year time horizon. The fact that such a large proportion of population dynamics are so locally variable vindicates the growing realization that dispersal, habitat connectedness, and large-scale processes are key to local persistence. Furthermore, for mammals, simply by knowing body size, age at first reproduction, and average number of offspring we could correctly predict extinction categories for 83\% of species (60 of 72).},

	abstract = {Disturbance frequency, intensity, and areal extent may influence the effects of disturbance on biological communities. Furthermore, these three factors may have interacting effects on biological diversity. We manipulated the frequency, intensity, and area of disturbance in a full-factorial design on artificial substrates and measured responses of benthic macroinvertebrates in a northern Vermont stream. Macroinvertebrate abundance was lower in all disturbance treatments than in the undisturbed control. As in most other studies in streams, species density (number of species/sample) was lower in disturbed treatments than in undisturbed controls. However, species density is very sensitive to total abundance of a sample, which is usually reduced by disturbance. We used a rarefaction method to compare species richness based on an equivalent number of individuals. In rarefied samples, species richness was higher in all eight disturbed treatments than in the undisturbed control, with significant increases in species richness for larger areas and greater intensities of disturbance. Increases in species richness in response to disturbance were consistent within patches, among patches with similar disturbance histories, and among patches with differing disturbance histories. These results provide some support for Huston’s dynamic-equilibrium model but do not support the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis. Our analyses demonstrate that species richness and species density can generate opposite patterns of community response to disturbance. The interplay of abundance, species richness, and species density has been neglected in previous tests of disturbance models.},

Resilience as an operational strategy of risk management has more recently been taken up in financial, urban and environmental security discourses, where it reflects a general consensus about the necessity of adaptation through endogenous crisis. The generalization of complex systems theory as a methodology of power has ambivalent sources. While the redefinition of the concept can be directly traced to the work of the ecologist Crawford S. Holling, the deployment of complex systems theory is perfectly in accord with the later philosophy of the Austrian neoliberal Friedrich Hayek.This ambivalence is reflected in the trajectory of complex systems theory itself, from critique to methodology of power.},

This article presents the origin of the resilience perspective and provides an overview of its development to date. With roots in one branch of ecology and the discovery of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystems in the 1960–1970s, it inspired social and environmental scientists to challenge the dominant stable equilibrium view. The resilience approach emphasizes non-linear dynamics, thresholds, uncertainty and surprise, how periods of gradual change interplay with periods of rapid change and how such dynamics interact across temporal and spatial scales. The history was dominated by empirical observations of ecosystem dynamics interpreted in mathematical models, developing into the adaptive management approach for responding to ecosystem change. Serious attempts to integrate the social dimension is currently taking place in resilience work reﬂected in the large numbers of sciences involved in explorative studies and new discoveries of linked social–ecological systems. Recent advances include understanding of social processes like, social learning and social memory, mental models and knowledge–system integration, visioning and scenario building, leadership, agents and actor groups, social networks, institutional and organizational inertia and change, adaptive capacity, transformability and systems of adaptive governance that allow for management of essential ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the concept of adaptation of human communities to global changes, especially climate change, in the context of adaptive capacity and vulnerability. It focuses on scholarship that contributes to practical implementation of adaptations at the community scale. In numerous social science ﬁelds, adaptations are considered as responses to risks associated with the interaction of environmental hazards and human vulnerability or adaptive capacity. In the climate change ﬁeld, adaptation analyses have been undertaken for several distinct purposes. Impact assessments assume adaptations to estimate damages to longer term climate scenarios with and without adjustments. Evaluations of speciﬁed adaptation options aim to identify preferred measures. Vulnerability indices seek to provide relative vulnerability scores for countries, regions or communities. The main purpose of participatory vulnerability assessments is to identify adaptation strategies that are feasible and practical in communities. The distinctive features of adaptation analyses with this purpose are outlined, and common elements of this approach are described. Practical adaptation initiatives tend to focus on risks that are already problematic, climate is considered together with other environmental and social stresses, and adaptations are mostly integrated or mainstreamed into other resource management, disaster preparedness and sustainable development programs. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper argues for three principal theses: ﬁrst, to invoke complexity, to refer to complex systems, is to proffer a form of explanation; second, in the context of the social sciences, the form of explanation that complexity represents belongs to a family of explanations which the recent theoretical literature associates with social mechanisms; and, third, complexity explanations refer to a speciﬁc type of social mechanism, whose features differentiate it from the other members of the family. The most signiﬁcant of these features is the jettisoning of the default link between order and design, which is precisely the principle omitted by an inﬂuential series of papers in the BMJ.

Complexity theory suggests that the relationship between complex environments and complex organizations advanced by the wellknown AshbyÕs law, may be reconsidered: only simple organization provides enough space for individual agency to match environmental turbulence in the form of complex organizational responses. We suggest that complex organizing may be paradoxically facilitated by a simple infrastructure, and that the theory of organizations may be viewed as resulting from the dialectical interplay between simplicity and complexity.},

By studying 235 ﬁrms, we found that (a) emergence variables positively inﬂuence ﬁrm product innovativeness, (b) different context variables have positive, negative, and nonlinear impacts on different emergence-related variables, and (c) emergence variables partially mediate the relationship between the CAS context and ﬁrm product innovativeness.},

	abstract = {The overexploitation of natural resources and the increasing number of social conflicts following from their unsustainable use point to a wide gap between the objectives of sustainability and current resource management practices. One of the reasons for the difficulties to close this gap is that for evolving complex systems like natural and socioeconomic systems, sustainability cannot be a static objective. Instead sustainable development is an open evolutionary process of improving the management of social–ecological systems, through better understanding and knowledge. Therefore, natural resource management systems need to be able to deal with different temporal, spatial and social scales, nested hierarchies, irreducible uncertainty, multidimensional interactions and emergent properties. The co-evolutionary perspective outlined in this paper serves as heuristic device to map the interactions settled in the networks between the resource base, social institutions and the behaviour of individual actors. For this purpose we draw on ideas from complex adaptive systems theory, evolutionary theory and evolutionary economics. Finally, we outline a research agenda for a co-evolutionary approach for natural resource management systems.},

	abstract = {Adaptive co-management brings together collaborative and adaptive approaches in pursuit of sustainable resource use and social–ecological resilience. Enthusiasm for this management approach, however, is countered by recent critiques regarding outcomes. A lack of evidence from consistent evaluation of adaptive co-management further exacerbates this situation. This paper revisits the issue of evaluation in natural resource management and recasts it in light of complex adaptive systems thinking. An evaluative framework for adaptive co-management is developed which directs attention toward three broad components: ecosystem conditions, livelihood outcomes and process and institutional conditions. Scale-specific parameters are offered for each component to facilitate systematic learning from experience and encourage cross-site comparisons. Conclusions highlight the importance of systematically incorporating evaluation into the adaptive co-management process and recognize the challenge for resource agencies and researchers to shift from a conventional to a complex adaptive system perspective.},

	abstract = {Using a combination of traditional ecological knowledge and science to monitor populations can greatly assist co-management for sustainable customary wildlife harvests by indigenous peoples. Case studies from Canada and New Zealand emphasize that, although traditional monitoring methods may often be imprecise and qualitative, they are nevertheless valuable because they are based on observations over long time periods, incorporate large sample sizes, are inexpensive, invite the participation of harvesters as researchers, and sometimes incorporate subtle multivariate cross checks for environmental change. A few simple rules suggested by traditional knowledge may produce good management outcomes consistent with fuzzy logic thinking. Science can sometimes offer better tests of potential causes of population change by research on larger spatial scales, precise quantification, and evaluation of population change where no harvest occurs. However, science is expensive and may not always be trusted or welcomed by customary users of wildlife. Short scientific studies in which traditional monitoring methods are calibrated against population abundance could make it possible to mesh traditional ecological knowledge with scientific inferences of prey population dynamics. This paper analyzes the traditional monitoring techniques of catch per unit effort and body condition. Combining scientific and traditional monitoring methods can not only build partnership and community consensus, but also, and more importantly, allow indigenous wildlife users to critically evaluate scientific predictions on their own terms and test sustainability using their own forms of adaptive management.},

All the links between components of this framework can fail and thereby reduce the robustness of the system. We posit that the link between resource users and public infrastructure providers is a key variable affecting the robustness of SESs that has frequently been ignored in the past. We illustrate the problems caused by a disruption in this link. We then briefly describe the design principles originally developed for robust common-pool resource institutions, because they appear to be a good starting point for the development of design principles for more general SESs and do include the link between resource users and public infrastructure providers.},

From sampling runs at 89 sites 2,893 estimates of coefficients of net reproduction (R) of 64 carabid species were obtained. The R-values of all species appeared to be lognormally distributed (LND). For each species realistic fluctuations of density could thus be simulated after estimation of mean and standard deviation of the fitted LND (Appendix). Simulation results were compared with field data in two ways: 1. The range between highest and lowest density (logarithmic range: LR), only for those sampling runs of 412 years that are not interrupted by zero year-catches. These LR-values were compared with those from simulated runs at similar catch-levels (n), i.e. runs with the highest catch between 89 and 89 "+1, if n = 1 , 2 . . . . ,7. As the number of uninterrupted (by zero year-catches) time series of catches decreases at lower catch-levels, by which the distribution of LR -values becomes skewed, each sampling run from the field could only be compared with simulations at the same catch-level. It thus appeared, that in the field density usually fluctuated within wider ranges than could be expected from the concerning simulations (where density fluctuated according to R-values drawn at random from the fitted LND). This means, that in the field the succession of R-values generally is less favourable than at random. This was especially evident for species with high powers of dispersal (T-species; glossary). In species with low powers of dispersal (L-species) the density range (LR) of field populations only at higher catch-levels agreed well with the expected values from the simulations.},

This formulation accounts for demographic effects, environmental variation, and catastrophic mortality. Accurate approximations are developed for large carrying capacity and large time. The main qualitative results are as follows: The probability of early extinction depends strongly on the initial population size. A substantial fraction of small starting populations become extinct within a short time. Those that survive the initial period typically survive for a long time. This skew in extinction times makes the expected time to extinction a misleading indicator. Probabilities of extinction are sensitive to environmental variation in the net reproductive rate and the shape of the distribution of disturbances, not just its mean. Probabilities of extinction are likewise sensitive to the rate of catastrophe occurrences and the shape of the catastrophe distribution, not just its mean. Diffusion approximations are likely to be inaccurate for small populations or for populations that show large changes in size in a single generation. These difficulties may be overcome by use of an extrapolation based on solutions for discrete population size and time.},

In this paper we examine the separate and interactive effects of intensity, temporal variation, and spatial extent of disturbance on temporal variance in assemblages of algae and invertebrates of rocky shores in the northwest Mediterranean. Temporal variation of disturbance is a predictor variable in the experiment, while temporal variance in abundance and number of taxa and in structure of assemblages are response variables. Multivariate analyses detected a positive relationship between intensity of disturbance and temporal variance in the structure of assemblages, while temporal variation of disturbance elicited the opposite effect. Univariate analyses conducted on the most abundant taxa revealed idiosyncratic patterns, while temporal variance in mean number of taxa was greatly reduced by disturbance, with no distinction among levels of intensity, temporal variation, or spatial extent. These outcomes suggest caution in interpreting the results of experiments in which intensity and temporal variation of disturbance cannot be separated. Distinguishing between these traits of disturbance may be key to predicting the ecological consequence of environmental ﬂuctuations, including those expected under modiﬁed climate scenarios.},

	abstract = {The process of desertification is usually modeled as a first order transition, where a change of an external parameter (e.g. precipitation) leads to a catastrophic bifurcation followed by an ecological regime shift. However, vegetation elements like shrubs and trees undergo a stochastic birth-death process with an absorbing state; such a process supports a second order continuous transition with no hysteresis. We present a numerical study of a minimal model that supports bistability and catastrophic shift on spatial domain with demographic noise and an absorbing state. When the external parameter varies adiabatically the transition is continuous and the front velocity renormalizes to zero at the extinction transition. Below the transition one may identify three modes of desertification: accumulation of local catastrophes, desert invasion and global collapse. A catastrophic regime shift occurs as a dynamical hysteresis, when the pace of environmental variations is too fast. We present some empirical evidence, suggesting that the mid-holocene desertification of the Sahara was, indeed, continuous.},

We developed empirical functions relating the occurrence of understory forest ﬁres to landscape features near Paragominas, a 35-yr-old ranching and logging center in eastern Amazonia. An historical sequence of maps of forest understory ﬁre was created based on ﬁeld interviews with local farmers and Landsat TM images. Several landscape features that might explain spatial variation in the occurrence of understory ﬁres were also mapped and co-registered for each of the sample dates, including: forest fragment size and shape, forest impoverishment through logging and understory ﬁre, sources of ignition (settlements and charcoal pits), roads, forest edges, and others. The spatial relationship between forest understory ﬁre and each landscape characteristic was tested by regression analyses. Fire probability models were then developed for various combinations of landscape characteristics. The analyses were conducted separately for years of the El Nin˜ o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which are associated with severe drought in eastern Amazonia, and non-ENSO years.},

Accurate estimation of forest biomass C is needed to provide information on C ﬂuxes and balances in such systems. The objective of this study was to develop generalized biomass models using harvest data covering tropical semi-evergreen, tropical wet evergreen, sub-tropical broad leaved, and sub-tropical pine forest in North East India (NEI). Among the four biomass estimation models (BEMs) tested AGBest = 0.32(D2Hδ)0.75 × 1.34 and AGBest = 0.18D2.16 × 1.32 were found to be the ﬁrst and second best models for the different forest types in NEI. The study also revealed that four commonly used generic models developed by Chambers (2001), Brown (1989), Chave (2005) and Chave (2014) overestimated biomass stocks by 300–591 kg tree−1, while our highest rated model overestimated biomass by 197 kg tree−1. We believe the BEMs we developed will be useful for practitioners involved in remote sensing, biomass estimation and in projects on climate change mitigation, and payment for ecosystem services. We recommend future studies to address country scale estimation of forest biomass covering different forest types.},

	abstract = {The choice of biomass estimation models (BEMs) is one of the most important sources of uncertainty in quantifying forest biomass and carbon ﬂuxes. This review was motivated by many mistakes and pitfalls I encountered in the recent literature regarding BEMs. The most common mistakes were the arbitrary choice of analytical methods, model dredging and inadequate model diagnosis, ignoring collinearity, uncritical use of model selection criteria and uninformative reporting of results. Sometimes, errors in parameter estimates were not checked and model uncertainty was ignored when interpreting and reporting results. Consequently, biologically implausible and statistically dubious equations such as ln(M) = ln(a) + b(lnD) + c(lnD)2 + d(lnD)3 + e(lnq) have been published as allometric models. These are perpetuated in the literature, databases and ﬁeld manuals and will pose a serious threat to the integrity of future forest biomass estimates. Through worked examples, I also illustrate that (1) allometric coefﬁcients can be biased by the choice of analytical procedures and methodological artefacts; (2) collinearity of predictors can result in coefﬁcients with unacceptable levels of error; (3) the R2 and Akaike information criterion (AIC) have been misused and have resulted in the selection of implausible BEMs; and (4) differences in the deﬁnition of model ‘‘bias’’ has sometimes led to contradictory reports. I propose corrective measures for most of these problems and provide suggestions for prospective authors on how to avoid pitfalls in interpretation and reporting of results.},

	abstract = {With the improvement of remote sensing techniques for forest inventory application such as terrestrial LiDAR, tree volume can now be measured directly, without resorting to allometric equations. However, wood speciﬁc gravity (WSG) remains a crucial factor for converting these precise volume measurements into unbiased biomass estimates. In addition to this WSG values obtained from samples collected at the base of the tree (WSGBase) or from global repositories such as Dryad (WSGDryad) can be substantially biased relative to the overall tree value. Our aim was to assess and mitigate error propagation at tree and stand level using a pragmatic approach that could be generalized to National Forest Inventories or other carbon assessment eﬀorts based on measured volumetric data. In the semi-deciduous forests of Eastern Cameroon, we destructively sampled 130 trees belonging to 15 species mostly represented by large trees (up to 45 Mg). We also used stand-level dendrometric parameters from 21 1-ha plots inventoried in the same area to propagate the tree-level bias at the plot level. A new descriptor, volume average-weighted WSG (WWSG) of the tree was computed by weighting the WSG of tree compartments by their relative volume prior to summing at tree level. As WWSG cannot be assessed non-destructively, linear models were adjusted to predict ﬁeld WWSG and revealed that a combination of WSGDryad, diameter at breast height (DBH) and species stem morphology (Sm) were signiﬁcant predictors explaining together 72\% of WWSG variation. At tree level, estimating tree aboveground biomass using WSGBase and WSGDryad yielded overestimations of 10\% and 7\% respectively whereas predicted WWSG only produced an underestimation of less than 1\%. At stand-level, WSGBase and WSGDryad gave an average simulated bias of 9\% (S.D. = ± 7) and 3\% (S.D. = ± 7) respectively whereas predicted WWSG reduced the bias by up to 0.1\% (S.D. = ± 8). We also observed that the stand-level bias obtained with WSGBase and WSGDryad decreased with total plot size and plot area. The systematic bias induced by WSGBase and WSGDryad for biomass estimations using measured volumes are clearly not negligible but yet generally overlooked. A simple corrective approach such as the one proposed with our predictive WWSG model is liable to improve the precision of remote sensing-based approaches for broader scale biomass estimations.},

The aim of this study was to develop site-speciﬁc allometric equations to estimate biomass of trees in tropical moist forests of Cameroon. For this study, 237 trees (1 D 121 cm) obtained by destructive method were used to develop allometric equations for the estimation of aboveground biomass. Allometric equations to estimate belowground and total biomasses were developed with 25 trees and 13 trees respectively. Trunk and crown biomass estimators were also developed in this study using 96 sample trees. Predictor variables considered were diameter, tree height, wood density and crown diameter. 237 and 235 trees were also used to develop regressions equations to estimate tree height and crown diameter respectively. For remote sensing applications, this study developed allometric equations to estimate aboveground biomass using crown diameter as predictor variable. Comparison of our biomass data to existing models showed that the equation of Djomo et al. (2016) provided the best estimator of total and mean biomass. Our study contributes to site-speciﬁc allometric equations and to the knowledge of belowground, above, trunk, crown and total biomass, which lack in most of the biomass data in tropical moist forests. Also, adding allometric equations with application to remote sensing, this study is a signiﬁcant input for the implementation of REDD+ in Central Africa.},

	abstract = {Wood density is an important variable in estimates of biomass and carbon ﬂux in tropical regions. However, the Amazon region lacks large-scale wood-density datasets that employ a sampling methodology adequate for use in estimates of biomass and carbon emissions. Normalization of the available datasets is needed to avoid bias in estimates that combine previous studies of wood density that used wood sampling at diverse positions in the bole or with various methods of density determination. This paper examines the question of whether regressions for radial variation and for variation in wood density along the bole, both developed in dense forest in central Amazonia (CA), are suitable for the open forests in southern Amazonia (SA) that are currently the target of most of Amazonia’s deforestation activity. The wood density of the heartwood and density of full disks or slices (bark, sapwood and heartwood) in each tree were measured to assess the radial variation. For variation along the length of the bole, wood densities at breast height and at the top of the bole were used. Moisture content of the bole was measured in SA and compared with values reported by studies from CA in similar dense forest. Comparing regressions that predict full-disk density from heartwood density, the pattern of radial variation differs slightly and signiﬁcantly between the two forest types (ANCOVA p = 0.006); the slopes have similar values but the intercepts differ. Variation along the bole in the two forest types does not differ signiﬁcantly (p = 0.144), so the CA model for predicting mean bole density from the density of a slice at breast height gives an unbiased estimate of the mean bole density when applied to SA trees. In SA the mean moisture content of the bole was 0.416 (Æ0.068 S.D.; n = 223 trees). Moisture content of the bole had a strong inverse relationship with basic wood density (r = À0.77), which explains the lower moisture content in the trees in CA relative to SA. A much weaker inverse relationship was found between moisture content and green wood density (r = À0.292). The relationship between wood basic density and green (‘fresh’) density presented in this study provides an alternative means of obtaining basic wood density directly in the ﬁeld when oven drying of samples is not possible.},

Despite the intrinsic dynamic, interdependent and nonlinear relationships of their parts, complex biological systems exhibit robust systemic stability. Applied to critical care, it is the systemic properties of the host response to a physiological insult that manifest as health or illness and determine outcome in our patients. Variability analysis provides a novel technology with which to evaluate the overall properties of a complex system. This review highlights the means by which we scientifically measure variation, including analyses of overall variation (time domain analysis, frequency distribution, spectral power), frequency contribution (spectral analysis), scale invariant (fractal) behaviour (detrended fluctuation and power law analysis) and regularity (approximate and multiscale entropy). Each technique is presented with a definition, interpretation, clinical application, advantages, limitations and summary of its calculation. The ubiquitous association between altered variability and illness is highlighted, followed by an analysis of how variability analysis may significantly improve prognostication of severity of illness and guide therapeutic intervention in critically ill patients.},

	abstract = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system’s behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980’s. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantiﬁcation of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system’s behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own ﬁeld of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difﬁculties and pitfalls.},

Although its importance to topics such as ecosystem services and resilience is well recognized, the broader relationship between robustness and evolution is only starting to be fully appreciated. A renewed interest in this relationship has been prompted by evidence that mutational robustness can play a positive role in the discovery of adaptive innovations (evolvability) and evidence of an intimate relationship between robustness and complexity in biology. This paper offers a new perspective on the mechanics of evolution and the origins of complexity, robustness, and evolvability. Here we explore the hypothesis that degeneracy, a partial overlap in the functioning of multi-functional components, plays a central role in the evolution and robustness of complex forms. In support of this hypothesis, we present evidence that degeneracy is a fundamental source of robustness, it is intimately tied to multi-scaled complexity, and it establishes conditions that are necessary for system evolvability.},

In medicine and in particular critical care, efforts have focussed on evaluating the clinical utility of variability. However, the growth and complexity of techniques applicable to this field have made interpretation and understanding of variability more challenging. Our objective is to provide an updated review of variability analysis techniques suitable for clinical applications. We review more than 70 variability techniques, providing for each technique a brief description of the underlying theory and assumptions, together with a summary of clinical applications. We propose a revised classification for the domains of variability techniques, which include statistical, geometric, energetic, informational, and invariant. We discuss the process of calculation, often necessitating a mathematical transform of the time-series. Our aims are to summarize a broad literature, promote a shared vocabulary that would improve the exchange of ideas, and the analyses of the results between different studies.

	abstract = {A review of research on the effects of hurricanes on coral reefs suggests that the intermediate disturbance hypothesis may be applicable to shallow reef zones dominated by branching or foliaceous coral species that are especially susceptible to mechanical damage from storms. Diversity (H') increases because of an increase in evenness following destruction or removal of the species that was monopolizing the space. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis as presented by Connell focuses on changes in number of species, but should be expanded to include diversity (H') and evenness. It should also be modified to incorporate changes in living cover and the time elapsed since disturbances of varying intensities. This hypothesis predicts that when cover is high, diversity will be low. However, research on coral reefs does not consistently demonstrate an inverse correlation of coral diversity and coral cover. An increase in cover and decrease in diversity with depth would also be expected because deeper reef zones generally experience less disturbance. However, higher diversity (both H' and species richness) is often associated with deeper zones. The effects of hurricanes on coral reefs will depend on the temporal and spatial scales under consideration, the life history characteristics and morphology of the dominant species, the depth of the reef zone, the ecological history of the site, and the influence of any additional natural or human stresses.},

The edges of these body-mass aggregations reflect transitions between available scales of landscape structure. Such transitions, or scale breaks, are theoretically associated with increased biological variability. We hypothesized that variability in population abundance is greater in animal species near the edge of bodymass aggregations than it is in species that are situated in the interior of body-mass aggregations. We tested this hypothesis by examining both temporal and spatial variability in the abundance of species in the bird community of the Florida Everglades sub-ecoregion, USA. Analyses of both temporal and spatial variability in population abundance supported our hypothesis. Our results indicate that variability within complex systems may be non-random, and is heightened where transitions in scales of process and structure occur. This is the first explicit test of the hypothetical relationship between increased population variability and scale breaks.},

	title = {Population {Variability} and {Extinction} {Risk}},
	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Population models generally predict increased extinction risk (ER) with increased population variability ( PV ), yet some empirical tests have provided contradictory findings. We resolve this conflict by attributing negative measured relationships to a statistical artifact that arises because PV tends to be underestimated for populations with short persistence. Such populations do not go extinct quickly as a consequence of low intrinsic variability; instead, the measured variability is low because they go extinct so quickly. Consequently, any underlying positive relationship between PV and ER tends to be obscured. We conducted a series of analyses to evaluate this claim. Simulations showed that negative measured relationships are to be expected, despite an underlying positive relationship. Simulations also identified properties of data, minimizing this bias and thereby permitting meaningful analysis. Experimental data on laboratory populations of a bruchid beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus) supported the simulation results. Likewise, with an appropriate statistical approach (Cox regression on untransformed data), reanalysis of a controversial data set on British island bird populations revealed a significant positive association between PV and ER (p ϭ 0.03). Finally, a similar analysis of time series for naturally regulated animal populations revealed a positive association between PV and quasiextinction risk (p Ͻ 0.01). Without exception, our simulation results, experimental findings, reanalysis of published data, and analysis of quasiextinction risk all contradict previous reports of negative or equivocal relationships. Valid analysis of meaningful data provides strong evidence that increased population variability leads to increased extinction risk.},

It starts off by presenting the core features of a view of complexity that not only deals with the limits to our understanding, but also points toward a responsible and motivating position. Everything we do involves explicit or implicit modeling, and as we can never have comprehensive access to any complex system, we need to be aware both of what we leave out as we model and of the implications of the choice of our modeling framework. One vantage point is never sufficient, as complexity necessarily implies that multiple (independent) conceptualizations are needed to engage the system adequately. We use two South African cases as examples of complex systems—restricting the case narratives mainly to the biophysical domain associated with NRM issues—that make the point that even the behavior of the biophysical subsystems themselves are already complex. From the insights into complex systems discussed in the first part of the paper and the lessons emerging from the way these cases have been dealt with in reality, we extract five interrelated generic principles for practicing science and management in complex NRM environments. These principles are then further elucidated using four further South African case studies—organized as two contrasting pairs—and now focusing on the more difficult organizational and social side, comparing the human organizational endeavors in managing such systems.},

Local community dynamics have been highly variable, however. Sites that were destroyed by disease in the 1970s are showing little or no recovery, while sites less than a kilometre away that were devastated by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 are recovering well. Strong coral recruitment has occurred in shallow, exposed areas that showed the greatest hurricane impacts, and these areas are now more species rich than in 1988, although coral cover has not reached pre-hurricane levels. Coral colony survivorship has been high throughout most of the study area. Partial mortality rates were elevated for several years following Hurricane Hugo, but significant whole coral-head mortality only occurred during periods with hurricane impacts and only at the most exposed sites. Overall, the coral community has proved resilient to closely repeated major hurricane impacts. From a single case study we cannot attribute this resilience to the relatively low level of human impacts, but grazing fish populations have apparently remained high enough to keep macroalgae in check despite the mass mortality of the herbivore Diadema antillarum in the 1980s.},

Analytical formulas are derived for the distribution of time to extinction and the cumulative probability of extinction before a certain time, which are determined by the initial age distribution, and by the infinitesimal mean and variance, \# and a2, of a diffusion approximation for the logarithm of total population size. These parameters can be estimated from the average life history and the pattern of environmental fluctuations in the vital rates. We also show that the distribution of time to extinction (conditional on the event) depends on the magnitude but not the sign of t. When the environmental fluctuations in vital rates are small or moderate, the diffusion approximation gives accurate estimates of cumulative extinction probabilities obtained from computer simulations.},

	abstract = {Background: Several methods are proposed in the literature for the quantiﬁcation of gait variability/ stability from trunk accelerations. Since outputs can be inﬂuenced by implementation differences, reliability assessment and standardization of implementation parameters are still an issue. The aim of this study is to assess the minimum number of required strides and the within-session reliability of 11 variability/stability measures.
Method: Ten healthy participants walked in a straight line at self-selected speed wearing two synchronized tri-axial Inertial Measurement Units. Five variability measures were calculated based on stride times namely Standard deviation, Coefﬁcient of variation, Inconsistency of variance, Nonstationary index and Poincaré plot. Six stability measures were calculated based on trunk accelerations namely Maximum Floquet multipliers, Short term/long term Lyapunov exponents, Recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis, Multiscale entropy, Harmonic ratio and Index of harmonicity. The required minimum number of strides and the within-session reliability for each measure were obtained based on the interquartile range/mean ratio. Measures were classiﬁed in ﬁve categories (namely excellent, good, average, poor, and very poor) based on their reliability.
Results: The number of strides required to obtain a reliable measure was generally larger than those conventionally used. Variability measures showed average to poor reliability, while stability measures ranged from excellent to very poor reliability.
Conclusion: Recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis and multiscale entropy of trunk accelerations showed excellent reliability and a reasonable number of required strides. Based on these results, these measures should be taken into consideration in the assessment of fall risk.},

	abstract = {Traditional biomechanical analyses of human movement are generally derived from linear mathematics. While these methods can be useful in many situations, they do not describe behaviors in human systems that are predominately nonlinear. For this reason, nonlinear analysis methods based on a dynamical systems approach have become more prevalent in recent literature. These analysis techniques have provided new insights into how systems (1) maintain pattern stability, (2) transition into new states, and (3) are governed by short- and long-term (fractal) correlational processes at different spatio-temporal scales. These different aspects of system dynamics are typically investigated using concepts related to variability, stability, complexity, and adaptability. The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast these different concepts and demonstrate that, although related, these terms represent fundamentally different aspects of system dynamics. In particular, we argue that variability should not uniformly be equated with stability or complexity of movement. In addition, current dynamic stability measures based on nonlinear analysis methods (such as the ﬁnite maximal Lyapunov exponent) can reveal local instabilities in movement dynamics, but the degree to which these local instabilities relate to global postural and gait stability and the ability to resist external perturbations remains to be explored. Finally, systematic studies are needed to relate observed reductions in complexity with aging and disease to the adaptive capabilities of the movement system and how complexity changes as a function of different task constraints.},

It is thought that variability in foot placement and timing reﬂects responses to mechanical instability while walking. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ‘extreme’ values of step length, width and time follow transient periods of low mechanical stability during the single support phase of gait in healthy young adults. We conducted secondary analysis of a portion of an existing dataset. Eleven healthy adults walked on an instrumented treadmill. Participants were outﬁtted with reﬂective markers and completed two 1-min periods of walking at each of 3 speeds (0.8 m/s, 1.2 m/s, and 1.6 m/s). Margins of stability were calculated relative to the anterior, posterior, lateral, and medial boundaries of the base of support, and the value at heel strike and the minimum value during the ﬁrst half of each single-support phase were extracted. Step length, swing time, and step width were calculated from motion capture and ground reaction force data. Extreme values for consecutive steps were identiﬁed using Poincaré plots, and margins of stability in each direction were compared between ‘normal’ and ‘extreme’ steps. Margins of stability in both the anterior and medial direction were lower prior to long and wide steps, respectively. Margins of stability in the anterior and medial directions were lower prior to quick steps, and margins of stability in the posterior and lateral directions were lower prior to slow steps. There were either no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in margin of stability between ‘normal’ and ‘extreme’ steps at heel strike, or the direction of the relationship was reversed to that observed during single support. These data suggest that spatio-temporal variability may reﬂect adjustments in step placement and timing to compensate for transient periods of low mechanical stability when walking.},

Work over the past two decades has demonstrated, however, that the alleged noise actually conveys important information. The magnitude of the stride-to-stride ﬂuctuations and their changes over time during a walk – gait dynamics – may be useful in understanding the physiology of gait, in quantifying age-related and pathologic alterations in the locomotor control system, and in augmenting objective measurement of mobility and functional status. Indeed, alterations in gait dynamics may help to determine disease severity, medication utility, and fall risk, and to objectively document improvements in response to therapeutic interventions, above and beyond what can be gleaned from measures based on the average, typical stride. This review discusses support for the idea that gait dynamics has meaning and may be useful in providing insight into the neural control of locomotion and for enhancing functional assessment of aging, chronic disease, and their impact on mobility.},

	abstract = {People at risk of falling exhibit increased gait variability, which may predict future falls. However, the causal mechanisms underlying these correlations are not well known. Increased neuronal noise associated with aging likely leads to increased gait variability, which could in turn lead to increased fall risk. This paper presents a model of how changes in neuromuscular noise independently affect gait variability and probability of falling, and aims to determine the extent to which changes in gait variability directly predict fall risk. We used a dynamic walking model that incorporates a lateral step controller to maintain lateral stability. Noise was applied to this controller to approximate neuromuscular noise in humans. Noise amplitude was varied between low amplitudes that did not induce falls and high amplitudes for which the model always fell. With increases in noise amplitude, the model fell more often and after fewer steps. Gait variability increased with noise amplitude and predicted increased probability of falling. Importantly, these relationships were not linear. At either low gait variability or very high gait variability, small increases in noise and variability affected probability of falling very little. Conversely, at intermediate noise and/or variability levels, the same small increases resulted in large increases in probability of falling. Our results validate the idea that age-related increases in neuromuscular noise likely play a direct contributing role in increasing fall risk. However, neuromuscular noise remains only one of many important factors that need to be considered. These ﬁndings have important implications for fall prevention research and practice.},

	abstract = {For targeted prevention of falls, it is necessary to identify individuals with balance impairments. To test the sensitivity of measures of variability, local stability and orbital stability of trunk kinematics to balance impairments during gait, we used galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) to impair balance in 12 young adults while walking on a treadmill at different speeds. Inertial sensors were used to measure trunk accelerations, from which variability in the medio-lateral direction and local and orbital stability were calculated. The short-term Lyapunov exponent and variability reﬂected the destabilizing effect of GVS, while the long-term Lyapunov exponent and Floquet multipliers suggested increased stability. Therefore, we concluded that only short-term Lyapunov exponents and variability can be used to asses stability of gait. In addition, to investigate the feasibility of using these measures in screening for fall risk, the presence or absence of GVS was predicted with variability and the short-term Lyapunov exponent. Predictions were good at all walking speeds, but best at preferred walking speed, with a correct classiﬁcation in 83.3\% of the cases.},

From this data, we estimated the vector from the center-of-mass to the center of pressure at each foot-strike. Dynamic stability of walking was computed by methods of Poincare analyses of these vectors. Results revealed that the fall-prone group demonstrated poorer dynamic stability than the healthy elderly and young adult groups. Stability was not inﬂuenced by walking velocity, indicating that group diﬀerences in walking speed could not fully explain the diﬀerences in stability.

Here, we describe a conceptual framework for the experimental study of motor variability that helps to unify geometrical methods, which focus on the role of motor redundancy, with dynamical methods that characterize the error-correcting processes regulating the performance of skilled tasks. We describe how goal functions, which mathematically specify the task strategy being employed, together with ideas from the control of redundant systems, allow one to formulate simple, experimentally testable dynamical models of inter-trial ﬂuctuations. After reviewing the basic theory, we present a list of ﬁve general hypotheses on the structure of ﬂuctuations that can be expected in repeated trials of goal-directed tasks. We review recent experimental applications of this general approach, and show how it can be used to precisely characterize the error-correcting control used by human subjects.},

The purpose of this paper is to: 1) review basic elements and current developments in entropy techniques used to assess physiological complexity; and 2) identify how MSE can provide insights into the complexity of physiological systems operating at multiple time scales that underlie the control of posture. We review and synthesize evidence from the literature providing support for MSE as a valuable tool to evaluate the breakdown in the physiological processes that accompany changes due to aging and disease in postural control. This evidence emerges from observed lower MSE values in individuals with multiple sclerosis, idiopathic scoliosis, and in older individuals with sensory impairments. Finally, we suggest some future applications of MSE that will allow for further insight into how physiological deﬁcits impact the complexity of postural ﬂuctuations; this information may improve the development and evaluation of new therapeutic interventions.},

Data were validated with 63 field plots using the Composite Burn Index (CBI). The relationship between spectral channels and burn severity was examined by comparing pre- and post-fire datasets. Based on the high burn severity comparison, AVIRIS channels 47 and 60 at wavelengths of 788 and 913 nm showed the greatest negative response to fire. Post-fire reflectance values decreased the most on average at those wavelengths, while channel 210 at 2370 nm showed the greatest positive response on average. Fire increased reflectance the most at that wavelength over the entire measured spectral range. Furthermore, channel 210 at 2370 nm exhibited the greatest variation in spectral response, suggesting potentially high information content for fire severity. Based on general remote sensing principles and the logic of variable spectral responses to fire, dNBR from both sensors should produce useful results in quantifying burn severity. The results verify the band – response relationships to burn severity as seen with ETM+ data and confirm the relationships by way of a distinctly different sensor system.},

	abstract = {Late-successional forests often have complex disturbance histories that can result in stands with widely varying structure, ranging from young pole stands to uneven-aged old growth. Arranging stands in chronosequences, however, is problematic because ‘stand age’ is not a meaningful concept for multi-aged stands and ‘time since last stand-replacing disturbance’ often cannot be determined from tree-ring evidence. In this paper, we describe a systematic approach for classifying developmental stages in late-successional forests using structural metrics known to be correlated with key ecological properties such as total biomass, carbon storage, stand production rates, and wildlife habitat. While conceptually based on the amount of aggregate crown area occupied by different size classes of trees, the computations in this study, for ease of use, are based entirely on absolute and relative basal area of four size classes (saplings, poles, mature, and large trees). Eight forest structural stages are recognized, including four stages of old growth (early-, mid-, late-transition, and steady state). The method was used to classify developmental stages of 70 primary northern hardwood stands (Acer–Betula–Tsuga) in large landscape reserves in upper Michigan, USA. The degree to which the developmental stages mimic underlying temporal trends in stand dynamics was investigated with the aid of 30-year permanent plot records in primary forests and multi-century simulations using the CANOPY forest dynamics model. Results indicated good correspondence between the postulated developmental sequence in the 70 ﬁeld stands compared with CANOPY simulations of structural changes over time and changes observed on the permanent plots. Results support the Bormann–Likens hypothesis that the number of large trees reaches a maximum toward the end of the lifespan of an even-aged cohort and subsequently declines in the steady state. While most of the ﬁeld plots were uneven-aged, both simulations and ﬁeld data suggest that developmental pathways of even-aged and multi-aged stands after disturbance are very similar and are difﬁcult to distinguish based on the form of the size distributions. In the study area landscapes, 78\% of the stands were classiﬁed as old growth, with 39\% in early or mid-transition and 39\% in late transition or steady state. The method should be useful, with appropriate site-speciﬁc modiﬁcations, in evaluating the degree to which stands meet structural goals under ecological forestry methods, in monitoring responses to environmental change, and in examining biotic changes along a gradient of structural development following disturbance.},

	abstract = {In late successional forests, stand development processes are often more easily monitored and are more closely related to key ecological parameters when using structural criteria rather than stand age or time since stand-replacing disturbance. In this paper, the effects of various disturbance regimes on long-term structural change and resilience in 70 primary northern hardwood stands were analyzed using the CANOPY individual-tree model. Compared to a ‘dichotomous’ disturbance regime of small gap dynamics with infrequent severe disturbance, the historic natural disturbance regime of periodic low- and moderate-severity disturbances produced a more complex landscape mosaic similar to the current landscape. Under the natural disturbance regime, mean residence time in each of 8 structural stages was short (8–35 years) and followed descending monotonic distributions. Mean residence time in old growth was 87 years. Old-growth stands with stable size distributions were much more frequent when deﬁned by relevant structural criteria than when deﬁned by their past history (timing and severity of disturbances). Repeated mild and moderate disturbances often caused stand structure to retrogress to mature or earlier old-growth stages without undergoing stand replacement. However, simulation experiments often demonstrated structural resilience to repeated mild disturbance, even at the 0.5 ha scale. In some cases, disturbances accelerated the development of more complex structure typical of late transition or steadystate stands. Recovery from heavy partial canopy removal was markedly faster than recovery after standreplacing disturbance. Stands recovered to an old-growth condition with a stable size distribution (‘quasi-steady state’) 175 years after disturbances removing 60\% of the aggregate crown area, compared to 280 years after a disturbance with no residual trees. High dominance of these landscapes by oldgrowth forest (78\% of total area) is due not only to the low frequency of stand-replacing disturbance, but also to the structural resilience of old growth to periodic episodes of low- and moderate-severity disturbance.},

	abstract = {As a result of a rapidly changing climate the resilience of forests is an increasingly important property for ecosystem management. Recent efforts have improved the theoretical understanding of resilience, yet its operational quantiﬁcation remains challenging. Furthermore, there is growing awareness that resilience is not only a means to addressing the consequences of climate change but is also affected by it, necessitating a better understanding of the climate sensitivity of resilience. Quantifying current and future resilience is thus an important step towards mainstreaming resilience thinking into ecosystem management. Here, we present a novel approach for quantifying forest resilience from thinning trials, and assess the climate sensitivity of resilience using process-based ecosystem modeling. We reinterpret the wide range of removal intensities and frequencies in thinning trials as an experimental gradient of perturbation, and estimate resilience as the recovery rate after perturbation. Our speciﬁc objectives were (i) to determine how resilience varies with stand and site conditions, (ii) to assess the climate sensitivity of resilience across a range of potential future climate scenarios, and (iii) to evaluate the robustness of resilience estimates to different focal indicators and assessment methodologies. We analyzed three long-term thinning trials in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests across an elevation gradient in Austria, evaluating and applying the individual-based process model iLand. The resilience of Norway spruce was highest at the montane site, and decreased at lower elevations. Resilience also decreased with increasing stand age and basal area. The effects of climate change were strongly context-dependent: At the montane site, where precipitation levels were ample even under climate change, warming increased resilience in all scenarios. At lower elevations, however, rising temperatures decreased resilience, particularly at precipitation levels below 750–800 mm. Our results were largely robust to different focal variables and resilience deﬁnitions. Based on our ﬁndings management can improve the capacity to recover from partial disturbances by avoiding overmature and overstocked conditions. At increasingly water limited sites a strongly decreasing resilience of Norway spruce will require a shift towards tree species better adapted to the expected future conditions.},

	abstract = {In the past several decades, a trend in forestry and silviculture has been toward promoting complexity in forest ecosystems, but how complexity is conceived and described has shifted over time as new ideas and terminology have been introduced. Historically, ecologically-focused silviculture has focused largely on manipulation of structural complexity, but often with the functional role of features in mind. Recently there has been a shift toward viewing complexity in an “adaptive” or “resilience” context, with a focus on understanding forests as complex adaptive systems. As new concepts and terminology are introduced it will be essential that silviculture researchers understand their dissemination into silviculture research, experimental design, and treatment implementation. With this goal in mind we set out to better understand: (1) how complexity terminology and ideas have shifted over time in silviculture, (2) how diﬀerent conceptions of complexity have been incorporated into silviculture experiments and treatments, and (3) how various complexity concepts are being reconciled with each other in practice. We conducted a multi-stage review of the silvicultural literature for the time period 1992–2017 that included: (1) a broad keyword analysis, (2) a detailed review of a narrower subset of publications, and (3) a thorough review of a set of silvicultural experiments that included a focus on complexity in their design. We also developed a set of case studies that illustrate shifts in complexity conceptions in silvicultural experiment design and analysis. Our analysis indicates considerable lags in incorporation of complexity-focused terminology and ideas into silvicultural research and experimental treatment design. Very few silviculture-focused studies have incorporated adaptive complexity concepts explicitly into design or analysis, even though these concepts were introduced nearly a decade ago and are widely discussed in the literature. However, in our case studies we document how silviculture experiments and research programs that were not designed explicitly around complexity concepts have begun to incorporate these ideas into analysis of treatment outcomes. Silviculture researchers should focus on reconciling conceptions of complexity through analysis of existing experiments and with modeling studies, as well as attempting to better understand mechanistic relationships among structural, functional, and adaptive conceptions of complexity.},

	abstract = {Temperate forests have been fundamentally altered by land use and other stressors globally; these have reduced the abundance of primary and old-growth forests in particular. Despite many regional studies, the literature lacks a global synthesis of temperate old-growth structural characteristics. In this study we compare literature derived data on mature and old-growth moist temperate forests with the aim of: (i) exploring global commonalities; (ii) investigating sources of variability among systems; and (iii) highlighting data gaps and research needs. We compiled a dataset of 147 records from 93 papers, and analyzed a set of structural indicators: basal area, stem density, large living trees, live aboveground biomass, quadratic mean diameter, and coarse woody debris volume. These indicators were contrasted between mature and old-growth age classes at a global level and across continents and broad forest types, testing for signiﬁcance through Monte-Carlo permutation procedure. We also related structural indicators to age, climatic and geographical descriptors. Our results suggest that all structural indicators vary across systems in relation to geographical, compositional, and climatic inﬂuences. However oldgrowth forests showed global commonalities in structure when compared to mature forests: signiﬁcantly higher densities of large living trees, higher quadratic mean diameter, and higher amounts of live aboveground biomass and coarse woody debris. Furthermore we found inconsistency in the structural variables reported by different papers; lack of studies on temperate forests in Russia, and Western and Central Asia. The ﬁndings improve our understanding of old-growth structure and function, and will help inform sustainable forest management and conservation approaches world-wide.},

Kernels have the advantage of directly producing density estimates that are not influenced by grid size or localization effects. Within this scheme, kernel density surfaces have been created and reclassified to construct fire occurrence zones at local to global scales in the Mediterranean Basin. Specifically, fire occurrence zones were created for the European scale (European Mediterranean Basin), national scale (Greece), regional scale (Peloponnese, Greece) and local scale (Chalkidiki, Greece). To evaluate fire occur rence zones, we compared the observed with the expected distribution of the number of fires within these zones using a Monte Carlo randomization test, finding that these numbers were statistically different in all cases. The deviations observed from the expected distributions towards the high occurrence zone indicated their successful assessment and value. In this paper, we further discuss their potential role and use for multi-scale fire management and policy in a European context.},

	abstract = {Intensive thinning prescriptions intended to restore historic forest structure have produced heavy broadcast slash fuel loads in northwestern Arizona, sometimes leading to high tree mortality following prescribed burning. Mechanical slash compression with a D-6 bulldozer to reduce the severity of fire effects on residual trees was evaluated. Ten of 42 measured trees (24\%) died within 2 years after burning of broadcast slash, and crown scorch of trees without slash compression treatment averaged 26\%. In contrast, no trees died after burning of compressed slash and crown scorch averaged Ͻ3\%, even though the total fuel loading was indistinguishable from the broadcast slash treatment. The practice of raking fuels away from the boles of old-growth trees also contributed to reduced scorch as compared to younger, unraked trees. Slash compression is a viable method of reducing mortality, offering ecological and economical tradeoffs. Benefits include the ability to reduce large quantities of slash, safeguarding oldgrowth tree survival while rapidly achieving open forest structure. Costs include paying for equipment operation as well as the possibility of damage to soils or plants. West. J. Appl. For. 19(3):149 –153.},

When indices were summed based on ranked correlations, the NBR was highest for both the post-burn and pre/post-burn approaches. The NBR had high correlations with the field-based CBI in closed needleleaf, mixed, and broadleaf forest classes. However, the NBR was useful as an index of burn severity only for forested sites.

The occurrence of a 4000-ha wildfire in the Linville Gorge Wilderness area in western North Carolina has provided a rare opportunity to study a large fire with a range of severities. The objectives of this study were to 1) assess the potential for using multi-temporal Landsat imagery to map fire severity in the southern Appalachians, 2) examine the influences of topography and forest community type on the spatial pattern of fire severity; and 3) examine the relationship between predicted fire severity and changes in species richness. A non-linear regression equation predicted a field-based composite burn index (CBI) as a function of change in the Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) with an R2 of 0.71. Fire severity was highest on drier landforms located on upper hillslopes, ridges, and on southwest aspects, and was higher in pine communities than in other forest types. Predicted CBI was positively correlated with changes in species richness and with the post-fire cover of pine seedlings (Pinus virginiana, P. rigida, and P. pungens), suggesting that burn severity maps can be used to predict community-level fire effects across large landscapes. Despite the relatively large size of this fire for the southern Appalachians, severity was strongly linked to topographic variability and pre-fire vegetation, and spatial variation in fire severity was correlated with changes in species richness. Thus, the Linville Gorge fire appears to have generally reinforced the ecological constraints imposed by underlying environmental gradients.},

	abstract = {Stand-replacement fires, particularly in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests, have replaced highfrequency, low-intensity historical fire regimes. We examined whether forest stands treated recently using silvicultural practices would be (1) less susceptible to stand-replacing crownfires, and (2) more ecologically and functionally resilient compared to untreated stands following extreme wildland fire. Reports detailing wildland fire behavior in treated stands remain largely anecdotal. We compared fire severity indices, fireline intensity (btu/ft/s), stand characteristics including canopy bulk density (kg/m3), and post-fire recovery indices in silviculturally treated vs. untreated forest stands in New Mexico and Arizona. Results indicated fire severity in pine-grassland forests was lowered when surface and aerial fuel loads were reduced. Specifically, as density (stems/ac) and basal area (ft2/ac) decreased and mean tree diameter (in) increased, fire severity and fireline intensity decreased. The more aggressive the treatment (i.e., where the canopy bulk density was reduced), the less susceptible forest stands were to crownfire. However, mechanical treatments where slash was scattered rendered stands susceptible to near stand-replacement type damage when wildfire occurred within 4 years of treatment. On our study sites, mechanical treatment followed by prescribed fire had the greatest impact toward mitigating fire severity (i.e., aerial and surface fuels were reduced). Treated stands were also more ecologically and functionally resilient than untreated forest stands following wildland fire.},

Treatments to reduce wildﬁre severity can reduce emissions, but with an immediate cost of reducing carbon stocks. In this study we examine the tradeoffs in carbon stock reduction and wildﬁre emissions in 19 fuels-treated and -untreated forests burned in twelve wildﬁres. The fuels treatment, a commonly used thinning ‘from below’ and removal of activity fuels, removed an average of 50.3 Mg C ha−1 or 34\% of live tree carbon stocks. Wildﬁre emissions averaged 29.7 and 67.8 Mg C ha−1 in fuels treated and untreated forests, respectively. The total carbon (fuels treatment plus wildﬁre emission) removed from treated sites was 119\% of the carbon emitted from the untreated/burned sites. However, with only 3\% tree survival following wildﬁre, untreated forests averaged only 7.8 Mg C ha−1 in live trees with an average quadratic mean tree diameter of 21 cm. In contrast, treated forest averaged 100.5 Mg C ha−1 with a live tree quadratic mean diameter of 44 cm. In untreated forests 70\% of the remaining total ecosystem carbon shifted to decomposing stocks after the wildﬁre, compared to 19\% in the fuels-treated forest. In wildﬁre burned forest, fuels treatments have a higher immediate carbon ‘cost’, but in the long-term may beneﬁt from lower decomposition emissions and higher carbon storage.},

	abstract = {Natural disturbances including wildﬁre, insects and disease are a growing threat to the remaining late successional forests in the Paciﬁc Northwest, USA. These forests are a cornerstone of the region’s ecological diversity and provide essential habitat to a number of rare terrestrial and aquatic species including the endangered northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Wildﬁres in particular have reduced the amount of late successional forests over the past decade, prompting land managers to expand investments in forest management in an attempt to slow losses and mitigate wildﬁre risk. Much of the emphasis is focused speciﬁcally on late successional reserves established under the Northwest Forest Plan to provide habitat for spotted owls. In this paper, we demonstrate a probabilistic risk analysis system for quantifying wildﬁre threats to spotted owl habitat and comparing the efﬁcacy of fuel treatment scenarios. We used wildﬁre simulation methods to calculate spatially explicit probabilities of habitat loss for fuel treatment scenarios on a 70,245 ha study area in Central Oregon, USA. We simulated 1000 wildﬁres with randomly located ignitions and weather conditions that replicated a recent large ﬁre within the study area. A ﬂame length threshold for each spotted owl habitat stand was determined using the forest vegetation simulator and used to predict the proportion of ﬁres that resulted in habitat loss. Wildﬁre modeling revealed a strong spatial pattern in burn probability created by natural fuel breaks (lakes and lava ﬂows). We observed a non-linear decrease in the probability of habitat loss with increasing treatment area. Fuels treatments on a relatively minor percentage of the forested landscape (20\%) resulted in a 44\% decrease in the probability of spotted owl habitat loss averaged over all habitat stands. The modeling system advances the application of quantitative and probabilistic risk assessment for habitat and species conservation planning.},

	abstract = {Prescribed burning to reduce surface fuel loads could help preserve pine stands by increasing forest ﬁreresistance, but its effects on tree growth, especially growth of European pines, are poorly understood. Characterizing the short and mid-term effects of prescribed burning on Pinus growth could provide valuable input to inform ﬁre and forest manager decision-making. Here we use dendrochronology and mixed modelling to investigate whether prescribed burning has differential effects on the mid-term growth of dominant and suppressed Pinus trees under different levels of ﬁre severity via an approach comparing observed post-burning growth against inferred tree growth without burning. Results showed reduced growth of Pinus halepensis and suppressed Pinus sylvestris at year of prescribed burning. Mid-term post-burning growths were good for dominant P. halepensis and Pinus nigra salzmannii trees subjected to higher ﬁre severities, whereas suppressed P. nigra nigra, P. sylvestris and P. halepensis grew less than expected without burning. Although prescribed burning tended towards negatively affect the mid-term growth of P. sylvestris and P. nigra nigra, trees with higher pre-burn growth rates showed better post-burn recovery. The effect of ﬁre severity on growth was positive for P. nigra salzmannii but negative for P. nigra nigra. These ﬁndings show that as time since burning elapses, growth recovery may depend on ﬁre-tolerance of the pine species, degree of ﬁre severity, tree characteristics and tree performance prior to prescribed burn. Understanding and balancing these factors in Pinus forests should help better plan prescribed burning, both in terms of desired ﬁre intensity and required burning intervals, without altering tree vitality.},

	abstract = {Broadcast seeding is one of the most widely used post-wildﬁre emergency response treatments intended to reduce soil erosion, increase vegetative ground cover, and minimize establishment and spread of nonnative plant species. We conducted an evidence-based review to examine the effectiveness and effects of post-wildﬁre seeding treatments on soil stabilization, non-native species invasion, and plant community recovery in the western U.S. We reviewed 94 scientiﬁc papers and agency monitoring reports identiﬁed using a systematic search protocol. As sampling designs have become more rigorous in recent years, evidence that seeding is effective in reducing erosion has decreased. Of highest and high quality studies evaluating soil erosion, 92\% (11 of 12) were published since 2000, none of which showed an effective result. Before 2000, the majority of the studies (71\%) fell into the lowest quality categories, of which 72\% showed seeding to be effective. The majority of studies (20 of 27, 74\%) evaluating soil erosion in seeded versus unseeded controls showed that seeding did not reduce erosion relative to unseeded controls. Even when seeding signiﬁcantly increased vegetative cover, seeded sites rarely supported plant cover levels considered sufﬁcient to stabilize soils within the ﬁrst and second year post-wildﬁre. Of the 11 studies evaluating seeding effectiveness for curtailing invasions of non-native plant species, an almost equal percentage found seeding treatments to be either effective (54\%, 6 studies) or ineffective (45\%, 5 studies). However, the majority of effective and ineffective treatments (83\% and 80\%, respectively) used non-native species. Sixteen of 26 studies (62\%) evaluating seeding effects on plant communities reported that seeding suppressed recovery of native plants, although data on long-term impacts of this reduction are limited. The literature suggests that post-wildﬁre seeding does little to protect soil in the short-term, has equivocal effect on invasion of non-native species, and can have negative effects on native vegetation recovery, although long-term studies are needed to assess lasting impacts of seeded species.},

Differences in the sampling and quantiﬁcation of dead wood can lead to differences in our understanding of forests and their role in the sequestration and emissions of CO2, as well as in developing appropriate strategies for achieving dead wood-related objectives, including biodiversity protection, and procurement of forest bioenergy feedstocks. A thorough understanding of the various methods available for quantifying dead wood stores and decomposition is critical for comparing studies and drawing valid conclusions. General assessments of forest dead wood are conducted by numerous countries as a part of their national forest inventories, while detailed experiments that employ ﬁeld-based and modeling methods to understand woody debris patterns and processes have greatly advanced our understanding of dead wood dynamics. We review methods for quantifying dead wood in forest ecosystems, with an emphasis on biomass and carbon attributes. These methods encompass various sampling protocols for inventorying standing dead trees and downed woody debris, and an assortment of approaches for forecasting wood decomposition through time. Recent research has provided insight on dead wood attributes related to biomass and carbon content, through the use of structural reduction factors and robust modeling approaches, both of which have improved our understanding of dead wood dynamics. Our review, while emphasizing temperate forests, identiﬁes key research needs and knowledge which at present impede our ability to accurately characterize dead wood populations. In sum, we synthesize the current literature on the measurement and dynamics of forest dead wood carbon stores and decomposition as a baseline for researchers and natural resource managers concerned about forest dead wood patterns and processes.},

	abstract = {The importance of deadwood in forest ecosystems is undeniable, not only in terms of the biodiversity values it provides but also in terms of carbon sequestration and emission. Its importance is evidenced in the international reporting requirements, which include the need for countries to detail their deadwood stock as an important indicator of sustainable development. In recent years, deadwood stocks have been included within the variables reported in the Spanish National Forest Inventories (SNFI), showing average values for total deadwood stocks of 8 and 10.5 m3 haÀ1 for the SNFI3 and SNFI4, respectively. However, SNFI are undertaken approximately every ten years, making it difﬁcult their use for accomplishing international reporting requirements annually or every ﬁve years. In this context, the objective of the present study was to attempt to model deadwood occurrence, stocks and dynamics using stand, topographic and climatic variables. The models developed considered different forest types, deadwood categories (standing dead trees; downed dead trees; standing saplings; downed saplings/small dead trees; downed coarse wood pieces/downed branches; stumps; coppice stumps) and decay classes. The data set comprises plots from the SNFI3 (3236 plots) and the SNFI4 (1066 plots) from the Basque Country region. Due to the differing characteristics of deadwood stocks in managed forests, where a large number of plots have no deadwood (from 34\% to 98\% depending on the deadwood category considered), zero-inﬂated models were chosen as the modelling technique. From the different zero-inﬂated models analysed, zeroinﬂated Poisson model was the one that showed better results. Despite the natural variability inherent in deadwood in the analysed forests, good results were achieved for total deadwood stock models as a function of forest types as well as for deadwood dynamics models. These models provide a promising approach for deadwood estimation in the period between the NFI’s and they can also be employed by private forest owners in forest management practices, particularly in the case of forest certiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {Deadwood biomass is one of the ﬁve terrestrial carbon pools that are relevant for the estimation of carbon stocks and carbon stock changes under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol (IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories). Statistics on this important ecosystem component are generally provided by national forest inventories: in the last few decades, national forest inventories in Europe have gradually included deadwood among the traditionally investigated components. However, deadwood is generally surveyed in terms of volume, which is then converted to biomass using basic density values. These are rarely speciﬁcally derived for the population under estimation; more often, values available from the literature and based on the ﬁndings of local studies are used instead. Based on a survey conducted by the Italian national forest inventory in 2008 and 2009 that speciﬁcally intended to more deeply investigate the carbon storage of forests, samples of deadwood were collected all over the country from the plots of the national forest inventory network and used to derive basic density values. This paper presents the basic densities obtained for groups of species (conifers, broadleaves), deadwood components (coarse woody debris, standing dead trees, stumps) and decay classes (using a ﬁve-class system). Fine woody debris was also surveyed, but in terms of weight and not volume. For such material, the ratio of dry weight to fresh weight for conversion to biomass is presented.

	abstract = {Deadwood decay is an important ecosystem process in forest ecosystems, but the relative contribution of speciﬁc wood properties of tree species, activities of wood-degrading enzymes, and decomposer communities such as fungi and insects is unclear. We ask whether wood properties, in particular differences between angiosperms and gymnosperms, and organismic diversity of colonizers contribute to wood decomposition. To test this, we exposed deadwood logs of 13 tree species, covering four gymnosperms and nine angiosperm species, in 30 plots under different forest management in three regions in Germany. After a decomposition time of 6.5 years Carpinus betulus and Fagus sylvatica showed the highest decay rates. We found a positive correlation of decay rate with enzyme activities, chemical wood properties (S, K concentration) and organismic diversity, while, heartwood character, lignin content, extractive concentration and phenol content were negatively correlated with decay rate across all 13 tree species. By applying a multi-model inference approach we found that the activity of the wooddegrading enzymes laccase and endocellulase, beetle diversity, heartwood presence, wood ray height and fungal diversity were the most important predictor variables for wood decay. Although we were not able to identify direct cause and effect relations by our approach, we conclude that enzyme activity and organismic diversity are the main drivers of wood decay rate, which greatly differed among tree species. Maintaining high tree species diversity will therefore result in high structural deadwood diversity in terms of decay rate and decay stage.},

This study evaluates the effects of ﬁre recurrence on seasonally dry tropical forests of the Chiquitania region, located in the southern rim of Amazonia, eastern lowlands of Bolivia. Effects were assessed in terms of changes in biomass, forest structure, species diversity and composition. Forest plots were established in well-conserved study sites to compare unburnt forests with forests burned once, twice and three times in the period 2000–2012. Inventories were collected for trees, palms and lianas, including identiﬁcation of species and measurement of morphological traits related to ﬁre tolerance. Biomass was estimated using different allometric equations, and species composition, richness, abundance and dominance were compared. We found a signiﬁcant loss in biomass, and putative effects on small and large trees after recurrent burns. The observed patterns in this study suggest that Chiquitano forests respond to recurrent ﬁres through a shift in tree species composition with already-present ﬁre-tolerant species becoming more dominant. This transition presented losses in biomass but increases in species richness. Insights into a possible transition to a more ﬁre-adapted state is of great relevance for forest and ﬁre management strategies in the region, as this transition may become irreversible in a future regime of more frequent wildﬁres, expected due to drier climatic conditions with increasing patterns of forest fragmentation and spreading use of ﬁre into new forest frontiers.},

	abstract = {Estimates of carbon-stock changes in forest ecosystems require information on dead wood decomposition rates. In the Amazon, the lack of data is dramatic due to the small number of studies and the large range of forest types. The aim of this study was to estimate the decomposition rate of coarse woody debris (CWD) in two oligotrophic undisturbed forest formations of the northern Brazilian Amazon: seasonally ﬂooded and unﬂooded. We analyzed 20 arboreal individuals (11 tree species and 3 palm species) with distinct wood-density categories. The mean annual decomposition rate of all samples independent of forest formation ranged from 0.044 to 0.963 yrÀ1, considering two observation periods (12 and 24 months). The highest rate (0.732 ± 0.206 [SD] yrÀ1) was observed for the lowest wood-density class of palms, whereas the lowest rate (0.119 ± 0.101 yrÀ1) was determined for trees with high wood density. In terms of forest formation, the rates values differ when weighted by the wood-density classes, indicating that unﬂooded forest (0.181 ± 0.083 [SE] yrÀ1; mean decay time 11–30 years) has a decomposition rate \$19\% higher than the seasonally ﬂooded formations (0.152 ± 0.072 yrÀ1; 13–37 years). This result reﬂects the dominance of species with high wood density in seasonally ﬂooded formations. In both formations 95\% of the dead wood is expected to disappear within 30–40 years. Based on our results, we conclude that the CWD decomposition in the studied area is slower in forests on nutrient-poor seasonally ﬂooded soils, where structure and species composition result in \$40\% of the aboveground biomass being in tree species with high wood density. Thus, it is estimated that CWD in seasonally ﬂooded forest formations has longer residence time and slower carbon release by decomposition (respiration) than in unﬂooded forests. These results improve our ability to model stocks and ﬂuxes of carbon derived from decomposition of dead wood in undisturbed oligotrophic forests in the Rio Negro-Rio Branco Basin, northern Brazilian Amazon.},

In total, 3491 CWD pieces were sampled. The chronosequence period covered a range up to 168 years. Single exponential decomposition (mass loss) rates (k) averaged 0.066, 0.032, 0.027, and 0.014 yearÀ1 for aspen (Populus tremula) and birch (Betula pendula, Betula pubescens), ﬁr (Abies sibirica) and spruce (Picea abies, Picea obovata), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica), respectively. At the regional-scale, the decomposition rate decreased with increasing difference between maximum and minimum temperatures. The CWD decomposition rate was greater on open fertile sites with moderate moisture compared to rates on poor dry or moist sites under closed tree canopies. CWD tree species played the primary role in decomposition at the CWD-piece scale. CWD position and tree mortality mode were rate-controlling mainly for decomposition of ﬁr and spruce CWD. CWD size did not affect decomposition rates. Our results predict CWD decomposition rates as a function of climatic factors, site conditions, tree species, stem position and mode of tree mortality in European boreal forests at the scale of regions, forest stands and individual CWD pieces.},

Downed wood was separated into fine ({\textless} 10 cm in diameter) and coarse ( 2 10 cm in diameter) classes, and three decomposition states (sound, intermediate, or rotten). The total quantity of dead wood, averaged by life zone, was lowest in the dry (2.43 Mg/ha), reached a peak in the moist (42.33 Mglha) and decreased slightly in the wet (34.50 Mg/ha) life zone. Most of the dead wood was in the standing dead category (about 42-76\% of the total). The decomposition state of dead wood in all plots was mostly rotten (45\%)or intermediate (44\%);there was little sound wood (11\%). Turnover rates of dead wood generally ranged between 0.03/yr to 0.52/yr with no clear trend with life zone. The large amount of dead wood in some plots was equivalent to about 20 percent or less of aboveground biomass, indicating that dead wood can represent a significant amount of carbon in these forests.},

We estimated the stump decomposition rates of the main European boreal tree species along a chronosequence of 0-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-, 40- and 50-year-old clear-felled sites with and without prescribed burning in southern and northern Finland. Estimation was done based on the bulk density and mass loss of above- and below ground wood and bark. The factors explaining the variation in mass loss during decomposition in decreasing order of importance were: stump part {\textgreater} tree species {\textgreater} vegetation zone {\textgreater} stump size {\textgreater} prescribed burning. In northern sites, stump turn-over time (t95) was 153, 104 and 100 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies) and birch (Betula sp.), respectively. The decomposition rates of above- and below ground wood did not differ from each other. In southern sites, where only the above-ground parts of stumps were studied, the turn-over time was 61, 56 and 43 years for pine, spruce and birch, respectively. In southern sites, the wood and bark of all tree species decomposed faster compared to those in northern sites, except for charred pine wood. Burning slowed down the decomposition of un-fragmented parts of pine and spruce bark in all sites and pine wood in southern sites (mean bark cover 32\%). It also facilitated the decomposition of birch wood in northern sites (mean bark cover 78\%) and increased bark fragmentation. Decomposition of birch bark in northern sites and birch wood in southern sites was slower for larger diameter stumps. Pine and spruce bark as well as birch bark in southern sites showed the opposite tendency since the size effect was dominated by the effects of fragmentation and burning. The bark of pine and spruce decomposed faster than the wood, whereas birch bark decomposed more slowly than birch wood. Bark fragmentation accelerated mass loss in all cases except for birch stumps in northern sites. Decomposition factors are interrelated and their relative importance should be taken into account when up-scaling the species-speciﬁc decomposition rate constants. Reﬁnements to decomposition rate estimates could aid in management scenarios to maximize carbon and nutrient storage and ensure the availability of stumps for maintaining biodiversity in intensively managed forests.},

	abstract = {Deadwood is a pivotal component of old-growth forests that plays an important role in both carbon sequestration and cycling. Deadwood carbon estimates rely on the conversion of easily measured volumes into dry masses, using decay-class conversion factors. Little is known about the speciﬁc dry density of deadwood in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) old-growth forests, especially in temperate mountainous zones. We studied speciﬁc density variations of standing and lying deadwood in an old-growth forest from the Central Eastern Carpathians. Using a balanced sampling, the piece size, rottenness percent (proportion of rotten wood within a sample) and decay, ordered in a 2-class scale for snags and an 8-class scale for logs, were recorded. For logs, the position of the sampling along piece (top, middle, bottom) and the contact with the ground were considered as additional factors. The decay classiﬁcation for logs was intentionally large, aiming to test for an optimal number of decay classes. The mean density showed small variations within snag classes (322.0 kg mÀ3/319.7 kg mÀ3), ranging between 342.7 kg mÀ3 and 151.7 kg mÀ3 for logs. The rottenness in snags was very even (40–43\%), while it increased with the decay class for logs as expected. The mean mass moisture variation was larger than in other studies, between 38.5–268.6\%, with the highest variation in the higher classes (5–8), while volumetric moisture varied between 11.6\% and 39.7\%. The samples from the base of the log positively inﬂuenced the moisture, while the contact had only marginal effects. The relationship between the dry density and the above factors was modeled using mixed-effect models. Apart from decay class, moisture and rottenness explained more variance than any other investigated factor (position, elevation, ground contact). The best model, which explained up to 76\% of the total variance, included the rottenness percent and the decay class as ﬁxed effects and the sample piece as a random effect. The overall best performing model on a four-class decay system had the same structure. We recommend using a decay system with fewer classes to effectively estimate speciﬁc deadwood dry density.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a systematic, unbiased national survey of deadwood volume and biomass in New Zealand’s remaining indigenous forests based on an 8-km grid of 894 permanent plots. New Zealand’s old growth evergreen temperate forests are largely comprised of long-lived, slow-growing tree species typically growing in cool, humid conditions; collectively these conditions are thought to promote accumulation of high deadwood stocks. We estimated deadwood biomass and volume in New Zealand’s forests and compared these stocks with published values from other broadleaved evergreen temperate forests. Mean deadwood biomass in New Zealand was 54 Mg haÀ1 but ranged across plots from 0 to 550 Mg haÀ1. Mean deadwood volume was 158 m3 haÀ1 and ranged across plots from 0 to 1890 m3 haÀ1. Fallen logs accounted for 63\% of total deadwood volume and 65\% of total deadwood biomass, with standing dead trees being the remainder. Each piece of deadwood was classiﬁed into one of three broad decay classes and {\textgreater}40\% of deadwood was fallen logs of the intermediate decay class. Deadwood biomass and volume varied 1.8- and 1.9-fold, respectively, among forest types and was greatest in broadleaved forests, dominated by Weinmannia racemosa (Cunoniaceae), Metrosideros umbellata (Myrtaceae) and Metrosideros robusta, and broadleaf-Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae) forests supporting the large tree species Nothofagus fusca. Deadwood biomass and volume were least in broadleaf-conifer admixtures. We used structural equation models to determine whether deadwood biomass could be predicted from climate and environment (vapor pressure deﬁcit, elevation and slope), live tree biomass, forest composition (captured by two ordination axes), wood density of live trees, and tree size (a proxy for stand age). The model that best ﬁt the data retained only vapor pressure deﬁcit, live tree biomass and the ﬁrst ordination axis as predictors of deadwood biomass. However, this model predicted just 2.4\% of the variation in deadwood biomass, suggesting that additional factors not captured by this dataset, such as disturbance dynamics, may control deadwood abundance. Comparisons with other temperate and tropical forests did not support the hypothesis that New Zealand’s cool temperate rainforests support higher than expected biomass or volume of deadwood.},

	abstract = {Our study examines dead wood dynamics in a series of permanent plots established in closed, productive second-growth forest stands of north-west Russia and in temporary plots that represent different successional stages and types of disturbance. Dead wood stores measured on 63 plots 0.2-1.0 ha in size range from 1-8 Mg C haa in young to mature intensively managed stands, 17 Mg C ha-{\textasciitilde}in an old-growth forest, 20 Mg C ha-t on a clear-cut, and 21-39 Mg C haa following a severe windthrow. A total of 122 logs, snags, and stumps aged by long-term plot records was sampled for decay rates and to develop a system of decay classes. Annual decomposition rates are: 3.3\% for pine, 3.4\% for spruce, and 4.5\% for birch. Based on these decay rates the average residence time of carbon (C) in the dead wood pool is 22-30 years. The mortality input on the permanent plots was 23-60 Mg C ha1 over 60 years of observation or 15-50\% of the total biomass increment. This data suggests a dead wood mass of 10-22 Mg C ha4 would be expected in these mature forests if salvage had not occurred. In old-growth forests, dead wood comprised about 20\% of the total wood mass, a proportion quite similar to the larger, more productive forests of the Pacific Northwest (USA). If this proportioning is characteristic of cool conifer forests it would be useful to estimate potential dead wood mass for old-growth forests without dead wood inventories. However, the use of a single live/dead wood ratio across the range of successional stages, a common practice in C budget calculations, may substantially over- or under-estimate the dead wood C pool depending upon the type of disturbance regime. Intensive forest management including short harvest rotations, thinning and wood sal{\textasciitilde},age reduces dead wood C stores to 5-40\% of the potential level found in undisturbed old-growth forest. In contrast, natural disturbance increases dead wood C pool by a factor of 2-4.},

Newly available geospatial data sets characterizing vegetation, fuels, topography, and burn severity offer new opportunities for studying fuel treatment effectiveness at regional to national scales. In this study, we used ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and sequential autoregression (SAR) to analyze fuel treatment effects on burn severity for three recent wildﬁres: the Camp 32 ﬁre in western Montana, the School ﬁre in southeastern Washington, and the Warm ﬁre in northern Arizona. Burn severity was measured using differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) maps developed by the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. Geospatial data sets from the LANDFIRE project were used to control for preﬁre variability in canopy cover, fuels, and topography. Across all three ﬁres, treatments that incorporated prescribed burning were more effective than thinning alone. Treatment effect sizes were lower, and standard errors were higher in the SAR models than in the OLS models. Spatial error terms in the SAR models indirectly controlled for confounding variables not captured in the LANDFIRE data, including spatiotemporal variability in ﬁre weather and landscape-level effects of reduced ﬁre severity outside the treated areas. This research demonstrates the feasibility of carrying out assessments of fuel treatment effectiveness using geospatial data sets and highlights the potential for using spatial autoregression to control for unmeasured confounding factors.},

Developing assessments and tools to help provide this information is a high priority for federal land management agencies such as the US Forest Service (USFS) that have limited resources to invest in hazardous fuel reduction and other mitigation activities. In this manuscript we investigate the degree to which fuel management practices on USFS land can reduce wildﬁre exposure to human communities. We leverage wildﬁre simulation with spatial risk analysis techniques and examine a range of hypothetical fuel treatment scenarios on a landscape encompassing the Sierra National Forest in California, USA. Results suggest that treating USFS land does little to reduce overall wildland urban interface (WUI) exposure across the landscape. A treatment scenario that focused on treating defensible space near homes was by far the most efﬁcient at reducing WUI exposure, including exposure transmitted from USFS lands. Findings highlight potential tradeoffs and raise questions as to what other land management objectives fuel treatments on federal lands might be able to more cost-effectively achieve relative to WUI protection. Site-speciﬁc risk-based analyses can help elucidate these tradeoffs and opportunities.},

Then, we performed Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to explore factors inﬂuencing the spatial variation in the mean number of ﬁres and the mean forest area burned, and to determine their relative contributions to this variation. Results showed that the north part of China generally had low mean number of ﬁres.

Neimenggu and Heilongjiang had larger mean burned forest area with 208,786 and 103,018 ha respectively. RDA analysis showed that the percentage of forest land and de Martonne aridity had signiﬁcant impacts on the spatial variation in forest ﬁre characteristics over China (p {\textless} 0.05). These two variables and their interactions explained 44.9\% of the total variance of the mean number of forest ﬁres and mean forest area burned (63\%), out of which 8.2\% was explained by percentage of forest land, 11.7\% by de Martonne aridity and 25.0\% by their interactions.},

We used the LANDIS model to study the effects of alternative fuel reduction strategies on ﬁre dynamics and analyzed cost effectiveness for each fuel reduction strategy based on cost–beneﬁt theory. Five levels of fuel treatment area (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10\% for each decade) and two fuel treatment types (prescribed burning [PB] and mechanical treatments in combination with prescribed ﬁre [PR]) under current ﬁre suppression simulated by LANDIS were compared in a 5 Â 2 factorial design over a 300-year period. The results showed that PR scenarios are more effective at reducing the occurrence and burn area of catastrophic ﬁres than PB scenarios. In addition, area burned by high intensity ﬁre can be tremendously reduced by increasing low intensity ﬁres with a higher level of treatment area under the various PR scenarios. The cost effectiveness of alternative fuel reduction strategies is strongly dependent on treatment area. In general, PB scenarios will be more cost effective in larger treatment areas and PR scenarios in smaller. We recommend mechanical treatments in combination with prescribed ﬁre, with 4\% of landscape treated in each decade (PR04) to be the optimal fuel reduction strategy in the study area based on risk control and cost efﬁciency analysis. However, the most challenging work in China is to make local forest policy makers and land managers accept the ecological function of ﬁre on forest ecosystems.},

Modeling results demonstrate reductions in the hazardous ﬁre potential across much of the treated landscape, relative to the untreated condition. These reductions persist throughout our modeling duration, 2010–2050. However, there was a strong effect of varying ingrowth levels, which were manipulated to generate different estimates of canopy base height over time, on hazardous ﬁre potential over time. Under the low ingrowth level, which resulted in the highest predictions of canopy base height, hazardous ﬁre potential steadily declined over time for the untreated landscape condition. The effect of varying fuel models in treated areas had much less impact on hazardous ﬁre potential, indicating a robust treatment effect. Our results demonstrate a coordinated fuel treatment network that incorporates local knowledge of ﬁre weather and likely ﬁre behavior patterns can have a substantial impact on reducing hazardous ﬁre potential. However, even with planned maintenance of the treatment network, hazard grows in untreated areas over time, resulting in an increase in overall ﬁre hazard. This suggests additional treatments, including ﬁre use, would be necessary to maintain low hazardous ﬁre potential.},

	abstract = {Warm/dry mixed conifer forests have undergone changes in disturbance regimes, forest structure, species composition, and surface fuel accumulation which have led to increased susceptibility to large, uncharacteristically severe wildﬁres and pathogenic outbreaks. Ecosystems resilient to ﬁre events return to a similar set of structures (e.g., forest and understory composition and density) or processes (e.g., ﬁre, decomposition rates); however, when exposed to disturbances outside the evolutionary envelope, may transition to a diﬀerent state (e.g., type conversion). We sampled warm/dry mixed conifer forest stands treated prior to the 2011 Wallow Fire and paired untreated sites ﬁve years following the ﬁre. Our objective was to evaluate mid-term ecosystem resiliency in terms of forest structure, bark beetle activity, and tree regeneration. We hypothesized that treated units would have higher mid-term post-ﬁre resiliency compared to untreated units. In 2016, average total tree density remained signiﬁcantly lower in treated compared to paired untreated units; conifer density and BA decreased in both treated and untreated units. Diameter distributions in 2016 treated units remained similar to those observed in 2012 with the exception of increased density in the smallest diameter class. In untreated units, the majority of tree density reductions occurred in the 10–30 cm dbh classes. Post-ﬁre tree mortality was stable across treated and untreated units, with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences; however, abundant ingrowth of small hardwoods occurred throughout the study area. Large-tree density decreased by about 20\% in both treated and untreated units between 2012 and 2016. Evidence of post-ﬁre bark beetles was generally low and patchy throughout the study site; however, beetle activity was more widespread in untreated units. Twice as many trees were attacked by bark beetles in untreated versus treated units suggesting treatments may have reduced post-ﬁre beetle activity. Following wildﬁre, observed conifer regeneration was lower and hardwood regeneration was higher with increasing burn severity; conifer regeneration was nearly three times higher in treated units. This study suggests that pre-ﬁre fuel reduction treatments contribute less to mid-term resiliency than to short-term resiliency of forested ecosystems. We observed trends of higher resilience to insect outbreaks and potential implications for type change from conifer to deciduous forest. Furthermore, our study underscores the importance of understanding mid-term post-ﬁre recovery, and while it provides insights regarding recovery of these ecosystems, additional monitoring and research is needed to fully understand the implications toward long-term resiliency.},

Factors such as disturbance severity, resource availability, and propagule pressure may influence where non-native species establish in burned areas. In addition, pre- and post-fire management activities may influence the likelihood of non-native species establishment. In the present study we examine the establishment of non-native species after wildfires in relation to native species richness, fire severity, dominant native plant cover, resource availability, and pre- and post-fire management actions (fuel treatments and post-fire rehabilitation treatments). We used an information-theoretic approach to compare alternative hypotheses. We analysed post-fire effects at multiple scales at three wildfires in Colorado and New Mexico. For large and small spatial scales at all fires, fire severity was the most consistent predictor of non-native species cover. Non-native species cover was also correlated with high native species richness, low native dominant species cover, and high seeded grass cover.

We attribute the moderated ﬁre severity in the treated area to a signiﬁcantly altered fuel proﬁle created by the repeated prescribed ﬁres. Though our results represent just one treatment area in a single wildﬁre, they add to a depauperate database and bring us a step closer to deﬁning the conditions under which fuel treatments are an effective pre-suppression strategy.},

	abstract = {We study the impact of stochastic perturbations to deterministic dynamical systems using the formalism of the Ruelle response theory and explore how stochastic noise can be used to explore the properties of the underlying deterministic dynamics of a given system. We find the expression for the change in the expectation value of a general observable when a white noise forcing is introduced in the system, both in the case of additive and multiplicative noise. We also show that the difference between the expectation value of the power spectrum of an observable in the stochastically perturbed case and of the same observable in the unperturbed case is equal to the variance of the noise times the square of the modulus of the susceptibility describing the frequency-dependent response of the system to perturbations with the same spatial patterns as the considered stochastic forcing. Using Kramers-Kronig theory, it is then possible to derive the real and imaginary part of the susceptibility and thus deduce the Green function of the system for any desired observable. We then extend our results to rather general patterns of random forcing, from the case of several white noise forcings, to noise terms with memory, up to the case of a space-time random field. Explicit formulas are provided for each relevant case analysed. As a general result, we find, using an argument of positivedefiniteness, that the power spectrum of the stochastically perturbed system is larger at all frequencies than the power spectrum of the unperturbed system. We provide a example of application of our results by considering the spatially extended chaotic Lorenz 96 model. These results clarify the property of stochastic stability of SRB measures in Axiom A flows, provide tools for analysing stochastic parameterisations and related closure ansatz to be implemented in modelling studies, and introduce new ways to study the response of a system to external perturbations.},

	abstract = {Given that fire is the most important disturbance of the boreal forest, climatically induced changes in fire frequency (i.e., area burnt per year) can have important consequences on the resulting forest mosaic age-class distribution and composition. Using archives and dendroecological data we reconstructed the fire frequency in four large sectors along a transect from eastern Ontario to central Quebec. Results showed a dramatic decrease in fire frequency that began in the mid-19th century and has been accentuated during the 20th century. Although all areas showed a similar temporal decrease in area burned, we observed a gradual increase in fire frequency from the west to Abitibi east, followed by a slight decrease in central Quebec. The global warming that has been occurring since the end of the Little Ice Age (-1850) may have created a climate less prone to large forest fires in the eastern boreal forest of North America. This interpretation is corroborated by predictions of a decrease in forest fires for that region of the boreal forest in the future. A longer fire cycle (i.e., the time needed to burn an area equivalent to the study area) has important consequences for sustainable forest management of the boreal forest of eastern Canada. When considering the important proportion of overmature and old-growth stands in the landscape resulting from the elongation of the fire cycles, it becomes difficult to justify clear-cutting practices over all the entire area as well as short rotations as a means to emulate natural disturbances. Alternative practices involving the uses of variable proportion of clear, partial, and selective cutting are discussed.},

We argue that the next generation of forestry practices need to understand and mimic natural disturbance dynamics much better than the present ones. Of particular importance is the fact that most species in European forests have evolved in forests that were to a large extent in¯uenced by large grazers, ®rst by megaherbivores and later, in historic times, by domestic animals. We highlight several areas where new knowledge and management tools are urgently needed: (i) How do species survive and adapt to the natural disturbance regimes in different regions and forest types?

(iii) How does forest biodiversity affect ecosystem function and stability in a changing world, in particular in the light of predicted climate changes?

Sites with different wildfire histories at the regional scale should exhibit different vegetation trajectories. Mean fire intervals and vegetation reconstructions are based respectively on sedimentary charcoal and pollen from two small lakes, one in the Mixedwood boreal forests and the second in the Coniferous boreal forests. The pollen-inferred vegetation exhibits different trajectories of boreal forest dynamics after afforestation, whereas mean fire intervals have no significant or a delayed impact on the pollen data, either in terms of diversity or trajectories. These boreal forests appear resilient to changes in fire regimes, although subtle modifications can be highlighted. Vegetation compositions have converged during the last 1200 years with the decrease in mean fire intervals, owing to an increasing abundance of boreal species at the southern site (Mixedwood), whereas changes are less pronounced at the northern site (Coniferous). Although wildfire is a natural property of boreal ecosystems, this study does not support the hypothesis that changes in mean fire intervals are the key process controlling long-term vegetation transformation. Fluctuations in mean fire intervals alone do not explain the historical and current distribution of vegetation, but they may have accelerated the climatic process of borealisation, likely resulting from orbital forcing.},

	abstract = {Given the increasingly global stresses on forests, many ecologists argue that managers must maintain ecological resilience: the capacity of ecosystems to absorb disturbances without undergoing fundamental change. In this review we ask: Can the emerging paradigm of natural-disturbance-based management (NDBM) maintain ecological resilience in managed forests? Applying resilience theory requires careful articulation of the ecosystem state under consideration, the disturbances and stresses that affect the persistence of possible alternative states, and the spatial and temporal scales of management relevance. Implementing NDBM while maintaining resilience means recognizing that (i) biodiversity is important for long-term ecosystem persistence, (ii) natural disturbances play a critical role as a generator of structural and compositional heterogeneity at multiple scales, and (iii) traditional management tends to produce forests more homogeneous than those disturbed naturally and increases the likelihood of unexpected catastrophic change by constraining variation of key environmental processes. NDBM may maintain resilience if silvicultural strategies retain the structures and processes that perpetuate desired states while reducing those that enhance resilience of undesirable states. Such strategies require an understanding of harvesting impacts on slow ecosystem processes, such as seed-bank or nutrient dynamics, which in the long term can lead to ecological surprises by altering the forest’s capacity to reorganize after disturbance.},

Herein, we compare the distribution of ﬁre-free intervals (FFIs) and the synchronicity of ﬁre events among sites, using Ripley’s K-function to determine the extent of the role of local-scale vs. large-scale processes with respect to ﬁre control. Between 8000 and 5800 cal. BP (calibrated years before present) the climatic and ecological conditions were less conducive to ﬁre events than after this date. After 5800 cal. BP, the number of ﬁres per 1000 years (ﬁre frequency) progressively increased, reaching a maximum ca. 3400 cal. BP. There was a sharp decrease in ﬁre frequency during the last 800 years. Between 8000 and 4000 cal. BP, comparable FFIs and synchronous ﬁre episodes were determined for the study sites. During this period, the ﬁre frequency was predominantly controlled by climate. After 4000 cal. BP, two sites displayed independent ﬁre histories (different FFI distributions or asynchronous ﬁre events), underlining the important inﬂuence of local factors, including short-term fuel wetness, characteristics of the watershed and landscape connectivity, in determining ﬁre occurrence. We conclude that climatic changes occurred during the last 4000 years that induced a rise in the water table; this may explain the high spatial heterogeneity in ﬁre history. Current and projected global climatic changes may cause similar spatial variability in ﬁre frequency.},

Stand composition influenced the char height: height of burn was lower in deciduous stands than mixed or coniferous stands. Analysis of species mortality rates revealed that Populus tremuloides Michx. was the least fire-resistant species, whereas Picea mariana Moench and Pinus banksiana Lamb. were the most resistant species. Efficient interactions for conifers exist between crown and cambial resistance to injury and fire behavior, as diameter at breast height (DBH), total tree height (TOTH), and mean bark thickness are characteristic variables throughout the fire behavior range. The best logistic regressions, relating probability of wildfireinduced mortality to morphology and fire variables, always entered char height (CH) at the first step of the stepwise procedure, followed by a morphological variable (DBH or TOTH). The Kappa coefficient used for model validations revealed that logistic regressions using morphologic and fire variables were very efficient as compared to logistic regressions based only on morphologic variables.

Paleoecological methods were used to categorize the severity of the last fire (high or low) and initial tree composition (Picea mariana versus Pinus banksiana). Changes in stand structure were evaluated by quantifying stand structural attributes along three chronosequences. Except for accelerating stand break-up, the post-fire presence of P. banksiana (which is eventually replaced by P. mariana) had little effect on stand structural development. Fire severity had significant effects on the evolution of stand structural attributes, with low severity fires being particularly detrimental for stand productivity. Stands colonizing low severity fires were characterized by low post-fire tree recruitment and growth and remained open throughout succession. In contrast, after high severity fires, dense productive stands were rapidly established regardless of tree composition and gradually became open as succession proceeded. These results suggest that in the prolonged absence of fire, the different stand structural development pathways gradually converge regardless of fire severity or initial composition. We argue that stand structural diversity within the coniferous boreal forest is a result of the severity of the last fire and of processes operating at the stand scale in the absence of fire.},

The occurrence of a recent spruce budworm outbreak around Lake Duparquet (48° 30' N, 79° 20' W, ca. 300 m a.s.l.) in northwestern Québec permitted a reconstruction of the stand composition before the outbreak, and also of the mortality of Abies balsamea due to the outbreak. The basal area of A. balsamea increases with time since fire in all site types but with increasing values for (1) rock and shallow till, via (2) till and mesic clay up to (3) hydric clay. Mortality (measured as percentage loss of basal area due to the outbreak) increases with time since fire but did not vary with site type. The increasing abundance of A. balsamea with time since fire is mainly responsible for this increase in mortality. Mortality for a specific basal area is, however, lower for the more recently burned stands suggesting a significant residual effect of time since fire. A landscape model integrating mortality due to the outbreak for stands of different age is developed. Both absolute and relative losses of basal area increased with the length of the fire cycles. According to this model, changes in fire cycle could explain a large portion of the spatio-temporal variations observed in outbreak mortality in the southeastern boreal forest of Canada.},

	abstract = {Fire history and forest dynamics were reconstructed for a 3800-km2 territory located in the south-central boreal forest of Quebec. Fire cycle was characterized using a random sampling strategy combined with archival data on fires that had occurred since 1923 on private land owned by Smurfit-Stone. Bioclimatic subdomain, land use, surficial deposit, and mean distance from a firebreak did not affect the fire cycle. Fire cycles have been longer since the end of the Little Ice Age (-1850). Warming after the Little Ice Age seems to have triggered a change in fire frequency. Forest dynamics were characterized by transition matrices for changes in dominant canopy composition from 344 permanent sampling plots. These permanent plots were sampled approximately every 15 years over the preceding 40 years. We observed two distinct patterns of replacement: (i) deciduous and mixed stands were replaced by balsam fir (Abies balsamifera (L.) Mill.) (and, to a lesser extent, by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP)) and (ii) jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) was replaced by black spruce. Analyses confirm that species replacement occurs in the eastern boreal forest of Canada when the fire-return interval is long enough and that the substrate plays an important role along with other disturbances, such as insect outbreaks. Our results also suggest that the proportion of old-growth forests ({\textgreater}100 years old) in the landscape should increase as a result of the lengthening of the fire cycle. More and more stands are likely to experience species replacement. From the standpoint of sustainable forest management, this perspective calls into question the widespread use of clear-cutting in the boreal forest. Regional context must be taken into account in forest management if the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity are serious objectives. Economically and ecologically sound silvicultural scenarios that emulate natural processes are discussed.},

	abstract = {We compared prefire and postfire organic-layer depths in boreal forest types (14 fires) across Canada, and examined tree recruitment as a function of depth. There was extensive within-stand variation in depth, much of it due to clustering of thinner organic layers around boles. There were no significant differences in postfire organic-layer depth among sites with different prefire forest species composition, but sites in the eastern boreal region had thicker postfire organic layers than those in the western boreal region. Mean organic-layer depth was much greater in intact stands than after fires; overall, fire reduced organic-layer depth by 60\%, largely because of increases in the area of thin ({\textless}3 cm) organic layers (1\% in intact stands vs. 40\% in postfire stands). There was more variation in organic-layer depth within postfire than within prefire stands; notably, some areas in postfire stands were deeply combusted, while adjacent parts were only lightly combusted. We speculate that the diminished role of energy loss to latent heat around tree boles increased organic-layer consumption around tree boles. Seedlings were clustered around burned tree bases, where organic layers were thinner, and the dependence of a species on thin organic layers was an inverse function of seed size. Re´sume´ : Nous avons compare´ l’e´paisseur de la matie`re organique avant et apre`s un feu dans diffe´rents types forestiers bore´aux (14 feux) a` travers le Canada et nous avons e´tudie´ le recrutement d’arbres en fonction de l’e´paisseur de la matie`re organique. L’e´paisseur de la matie`re organique variait beaucoup a` l’inte´rieur des peuplements surtout parce que les couches plus minces e´taient concentre´es autour des arbres. Apre`s un feu, il n’y avait pas de diffe´rence significative dans l’e´paisseur de la matie`re organique entre les stations dont la composition avant le feu e´tait diffe´rente, mais la matie`re organique e´tait plus e´paisse dans les stations de la foreˆt bore´ale de l’est que dans celles de la foreˆt bore´ale de l’ouest. Avant le feu, la matie`re organique des peuplements e´tait plus e´paisse qu’apre`s le feu. De fac¸on ge´ne´rale, le feu a diminue´ l’e´paisseur de la couche de matie`re organique de 60 \%, en grande partie a` cause de l’augmentation de la surface couverte par une mince ({\textless}3 cm) couche de matie`re organique (1 \% dans les peuplements non bruˆle´s vs 40 \% dans les peuplements bruˆle´s). L’e´paisseur de la matie`re organique e´tait plus variable a` l’inte´rieur des peuplements apre`s le feu qu’avant le feu, notamment en raison des surfaces profonde´ment bruˆle´es qui coˆtoyaient des surfaces le´ge`rement bruˆle´es a` la suite du passage du feu. Nous avanc¸ons l’hypothe`se que la diminution de la perte d’e´nergie en chaleur latente autour des arbres cause une augmentation de la consommation de la couche organique autour des troncs.

	abstract = {Within the context of studying the ecological impacts of wildland fires in the boreal forest, a spatial analysis of a major wildfire was conducted. The fire covered nearly 500 km2 in the north-western part of Quebec’s boreal forest in the summer of 1995. The spatial distribution of different fire impacts on the forest canopy was obtained using timber damage assessment maps. Fire impacts varied throughout the burned area, ranging from areas where trees had completely burned crowns (43\%) to remaining patches of trees with green foliage (3\%). The effects of local stand and site factors on crown fire, as assessed by the fire impacts, were evaluated using geographic information systems. Despite the large extent and high intensity of the wildfire created by extreme fire weather conditions, stepwise logistic regression and analysis by log–linear models indicated that variations in surface material, stand composition, and estimated stand age played a role in the presence or absence of crowning at the stand level. However, it appears that height and density of stand, as well as topography, did not have a significant influence. Our study presents the variability of fire impacts and its implications, and it provides a better understanding of the relationships between landscape components and fire crowning.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates how optimal economic growth can affect the natural evolution of the ecological system. Policy makers may perform defensive actions to protect biodiversity. These actions, however, may deeply modify the natural ecological dynamics so that the resulting equilibrium has different dynamic features with respect to the equilibrium that would have naturally emerged without human intervention. To investigate this issue more deeply, we analyze the impact that economic activity and environmental defensive choices can have on the natural ecological dynamics depending on whether agents care or do not care for biodiversity. Using an optimal growth model with pollution, in which biodiversity loss may be caused by the negative side-effects of aggregate production, we show that human action can modify the stability of the ecological ﬁxed points. In particular, from the simple analytical formulations adopted in the paper, it emerges that – when the levels of the species is sufﬁciently low at the ﬁxed point and agents care for biodiversity – human intervention may cause a stabilization of the ﬁxed point and thus avoid the extinction of a species, even in the absence of defensive expenditures speciﬁcally ﬁnalized at the protection of that species. It follows that the protection of biodiversity (through the stabilization of the ecological system) may come at the cost of a change in the original features of the natural dynamics. Moreover, it is shown that a limit cycle may arise through a Hopf bifurcation from the interaction of the economic and ecological systems even though none of the two systems taken separately admits a limit cycle. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The response of an ecosystem to disturbance reﬂects its stability, which is determined by two components: resistance and resilience. We addressed both components in a study of early post-ﬁre response of natural broadleaved forest (Quercus robur, Ilex aquifolium) and pine plantation (Pinus pinaster, Pinus sylvestris) to a wildﬁre that burned over 6000 ha in NW Portugal. Fire resistance was assessed from ﬁre severity, tree mortality and sapling persistence. Understory ﬁre resistance was similar between forests: ﬁre severity at the surface level was moderate to low, and sapling persistence was low. At the canopy level, ﬁre severity was generally low in broadleaved forest but heterogeneous in pine forest, and mean tree mortality was signiﬁcantly higher in pine forest. Forest resilience was assessed by the comparison of the understory composition, species diversity and seedling abundance in unburned and burned plots in each forest type. Unburned broadleaved communities were dominated by perennial herbs (e.g., Arrhenatherum elatius) and woody species (e.g., Hedera hibernica, Erica arborea), all able to regenerate vegetatively. Unburned pine communities presented a higher abundance of shrubs, and most dominant species relied on post-ﬁre seeding, with some species also being able to regenerate vegetatively (e.g., Ulex minor, Daboecia cantabrica). There were no differences in diversity measures in broadleaved forest, but burned communities in pine forest shared less species and were less rich and diverse than unburned communities. Seedling abundance was similar in burned and unburned plots in both forests. The slower reestablishment of understory pine communities is probably explained by the slower recovery rate of dominant species. These ﬁndings are ecologically relevant: the higher resistance and resilience of native broadleaved forest implies a higher stability in the maintenance of forest processes and the delivery of ecosystem services.},

These proposals are intended for use in guiding tropical forest management but the indicators and verifiers we describe are not in the form of simple prescriptions where a single measurement can be recommended for a single causal effect. Since genetic dynamics operate at a different time and spatial scale than the events that can be observed at the level of forest stand effects, a single forest stand event can have effects on several genetic processes. In addition, the pattern of genetic diversity that has already evolved is due to a balance of several evolutionary forces that operate at different spatial and temporal scales and forest practices would therefore be expected to affect several genetic factors. To provide guidance on what genetic processes may be affected by forest practices, we therefore first describe the factors that affect genetic processes and then provide a matrix of relationships between types of forest level events and genetically significant factors.},

	abstract = {Ecological indicators can be used to assess the condition of the environment, to provide an early warning signal of changes in the environment, or to diagnose the cause of an environmental problem. Ideally the suite of indicators should represent key information about structure, function, and composition of the ecological system. Three concerns hamper the use of ecological indicators as a resource management tool. (1) Monitoring programs often depend on a small number of indicators and fail to consider the full complexity of the ecological system. (2) Choice of ecological indicators is confounded in management programs that have vague long-term goals and objectives. (3) Management and monitoring programs often lack scientiﬁc rigor because of their failure to use a deﬁned protocol for identifying ecological indicators. Thus, ecological indicators need to capture the complexities of the ecosystem yet remain simple enough to be easily and routinely monitored. Ecological indicators should meet the following criteria: be easily measured, be sensitive to stresses on the system, respond to stress in a predictable manner, be anticipatory, predict changes that can be averted by management actions, be integrative, have a known response to disturbances, anthropogenic stresses, and changes over time, and have low variability in response. The challenge is to derive a manageable set of indicators that together meet these criteria. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems and ecosystem services are subjected to both typical disturbances (e.g., ﬁre) and shifting climatic baselines resulting from anthropogenic drivers. Recovery from these perturbations is of prime interest to researchers and land managers. We explore how differing regeneration of the coniferous forest to speciﬁc disturbances and a shifting climate are mediated through managerial responses, in terms of both species composition and an important ecosystem service, carbon sequestration in the southern Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. 112 sites across a variety of disturbance histories were surveyed for post-ﬁre regeneration; carbon stock growth was then simulated in the US Forest Service Forest Vegetation Simulator under a variety of climate change scenarios for 100 years. Simultaneously, we simulated three managerial responses to the disturbance: no action, planting of local species (resilience-oriented management), and planting of the most climatically suitable species (adaptation-oriented management). These managerial responses simulate varying levels of intervention which attempt to maintain forest properties and associated carbon stocks. Carbon stocks, initially, were more resilient than the coniferous forest system; areas with little coniferous regeneration recovered carbon at a similar pace due to an inﬂux of deciduous seedlings. However, future climate exerts a strong inﬂuence on carbon stocks. Both the no-action scenario and the resilience-oriented management scenario transitioned to non-forest by the end of the simulation period, due to climatic changes. Active, adaptation-oriented management, which included establishment of non-local species, maintained forest structure and carbon stocks under most future climate projections, albeit at lower densities. So while this preserves the presence of a forest, it does not preserve the presence of a speciﬁc forest. However, for ecosystem services associated with the mere existence of forest cover (e.g., carbon stocks and general forest habitat), this may be sufﬁcient. In a sense, disturbances are opportunities for more climatically-adapted species/communities to establish, although the complexities of assisted migration and novel ecosystems remain.},

In this paper, we review existing forest growth and ecosystem models from the point of view of applicability to prediction of indicators of sustainable management, focusing on stand scale models and management. To do this, we ﬁrst present a conceptual framework for understanding the role of models in assessing forest management at the stand level in the context of sustainability criteria and indicators. We classify the criteria into those predictable using models operating at the stand scale, and those derivable either through scaling up or as solutions of a multi-objective management optimisation problem.},

While the construction of such a global index is methodologically difﬁcult and arguable, it could be very useful to land planners when drawing up and reviewing forestry and environmental policies. The global index of forest sustainability suggested in this study is calculated for the ﬁfty Spanish provinces, based on a selection of twenty indicators. The majority of them (thirteen) relate to environmental dimension, four to economic dimension and three to social dimension. Numerous statistics and cartographic sources are used. A methodology is proposed based on grouping selected indicators according to three intermediate composite indicators and, subsequently, a global super-index. Cluster analysis establishes four different types of provinces according to their forest sustainability. According to the global sustainability index, part of the forests of the Mediterranean coast, those located near large inland cities and in southern Galicia appear to be less sustainable as a consequence of land artiﬁcialisation processes and forest ﬁres. Conversely, Atlantic and Pyrenees forests, and those of the northern Plateau are more sustainable due to their relative success in keeping forest traditional uses and containing emerging threats.},

	abstract = {Sustainable forest management (SFM) is many things to many people – yet a common thread is the production of forest goods and services for the present and future generations. The promise of sustainability is rooted in the two premises; ﬁrst that ecosystems have the potential to renew themselves and second that economic activities and social perceptions or values that deﬁne human interaction with the environment are choices that can be modiﬁed to ensure the long term productivity and health of the ecosystem. SFM addresses a great challenge in matching the increasing demands of a growing human population while maintaining ecological functions of healthy forest ecosystems. This paper does not seek to deﬁne SFM, but rather provides analyses of key indicators for the national-scale enabling environment to gain a global insight into progress in implementing enabling and implementing SFM at the national and operational levels. Analyses of the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 (FRA) country report data are used to provide insights into the current state of progress in implementing the enabling conditions for SFM. Over 2.17 billion ha of the world’s forest area are predicted by governments to remain in permanent forest land use, of which some 1.1 billion ha are covered by all of the SFM tools investigated in FRA 2015. At the global scale, SFM-related policies and regulations are reported to be in place on 97\% of global forest area. While the number of countries with national forest inventories has increased over that past ten years from 48 to 112, only 37\% of forests in low income countries are covered by forest inventories. Forest management planning and monitoring of plans has increased substantially as has forest management certiﬁcation, which exceeded a total of over 430 million ha in 2014. However, 90\% of internationally veriﬁed certiﬁcation is in the boreal and temperate climatic domains – only 6\% of permanent forests in the tropical domain have been certiﬁed as of 2014. Results show that more work is needed to expand the extent and depth of work on establishing the enabling conditions that support SFM over the long term and suggests where those needs are greatest.},

	abstract = {Besides traditional timber production, other forest functions, such as biodiversity and recreation, have gained increasing importance during the last few decades. Demands on forests have become more diversiﬁed, thus making forest management and planning more complex. To meet these challenges, there is a growing interest in a more diversiﬁed silviculture, for which a number of diﬀerent management options are available. However, it remains unclear how the various management options aﬀect economic, ecological, and social aspects of sustainable forest management. Hence, in this study, we assess the consequences of various management options on diﬀerent aspects of sustainable forest management through scenario analysis using a forestry decision support system. We evaluate 10 diﬀerent forest management scenarios for two contrasting municipalities in Sweden, based on expert participation by way of a web-based multi-criteria decision analysis framework. We asked experts in economic, ecological, and social forest values, as well as those in reindeer husbandry, to weigh a number of indicators in their ﬁeld of expertise against each other, and to create value functions for each indicator. We then determined scenario ranking for diﬀerent sets of weights for economic, ecological and social forest values. Our results indicate that current management practices are favorable for economic aspects (wood production), while a number of scenarios would be better suited to fulﬁll the Swedish co-equal forest policy goal of production and consideration of environmental issues, such as scenarios with longer rotation periods, a larger share of set-asides and a higher share of continuous cover forestry. These measures would be beneﬁcial not only for ecological values, but also for social values and for reindeer husbandry. Furthermore, we found that expert participation through the web-tool was a promising alternative to physical meetings that require more commitment in terms of time and resources.},

	abstract = {This paper explains why nine criteria and indicator schemes for forest management are little used instrumentally to monitor sustainability, at most being used to structure reports or statistics, and why the schemes lack coherent designs, with only 29\% of indicators in ﬁve schemes suited to practical monitoring. It outlines a new Knowledge-Action Framework, devised to analyse governing across the spectrum from government to the new style of governance, in which society steers itself. This proposes that conceptual and symbolic uses may be as important in governance as instrumental uses; science is less privileged; and indicator choice must satisfy a wider range of stakeholders than previously. Conceptual uses enable unambiguous learning by multiple stakeholders with conﬂicting views in governance; symbolic uses promote an ambiguous consensus between them; and the large numbers of indicators accumulated achieve ‘plurality of satisfaction’ but make monitoring impractical. Conceptual and symbolic uses are examples of new procedural policy instruments that facilitate multidirectional interactions between diverse groups in governance. Criteria and indicator schemes are termed procedural policy tools as they combine various procedural instruments. A new generic taxonomy shows continuity as substantive policy instruments long used by governments evolve into procedural instruments. Evaluation of the schemes ﬁnds evidence for conceptual and symbolic uses, indicator accumulation and restrictions on scientiﬁc inputs. The paper advances global environmental governance theory, and argues that the best way to overcome constraints on sustainability monitoring is through autonomous scientiﬁc research.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty is an important issue in the support of any forestry decision. Forestry decision making today typically involves objectives and information concerning ecological, economic and social issues. The consequences of alternative forest management programmes might be hard to assess, and predictions and assessments always include uncertainty. Forestry decisions also often concern large areas, long time horizons and multiple stakeholders, which further complicates forest management planning and increases uncertainty involved in it. This paper deals with different definitions and classifications of uncertainty, sources of uncertainty, and theories and methodologies presented to deal with uncertainty. The aim is to provide readers with an overview of alternative approach for coping with uncertainty, especially from the viewpoint of forestry and natural resource management applications. Generally taken, there are two main conventional approaches, namely classical (frequentist) and Bayesian probability theory. These lead to either classical or Bayesian decision theory, respectively. In addition, uncertainty can be dealt with, for instance, using the fuzzy set theory. This theory mostly deals with uncertainty due to the ambiguity of concepts. So far, in decision support tools, probability and fuzzy set theory are the most common approaches. However, the possibility theory and the evidence theory, for instance, can also be relied upon when managing uncertainty. These theories deal with subjective beliefs and expert judgements. They are able to deal with partial information and pure ignorance. The counterparts to the classical decision rules based on these theories are presented, as well as some decision support methods designed using the approaches presented. Because of the manifold sources of uncertainty, all these approaches can have application in the support of forestry decisions.},

However, the interaction among natural and anthropogenic factors and their impacts on the occurrence and distribution of forest ﬁres in China, a vast country with enormous variation in its environmental and social contexts, has remained a lasting challenge in science and forest management. In this study, ground-based data of forest ﬁres at the county level in China’s forest ﬁre hazards survey (1989–1991) were applied in studying forest ﬁres and ﬁve relevant factors: climate, fuel, topography, human activity, and ﬁreﬁghting facilities at national and provincial scales. During the study period, the county-level number of forest ﬁres in China increased with decreasing latitude, and the burnt area was larger in the subtropical region and some counties of Northeast China. Industry ﬁres and recreation ﬁres showed contrasting latitudinal patterns, and cultural ﬁres dominated in North China. Lightning ﬁres constituted less than 1\% of forest ﬁres, and dominated in only six counties. Results of a random forest model indicated that spring temperature and forest stocking level were respectively the most critical variables aﬀecting the ﬁre number and burnt area across China, and overall threshold values of mean spring temperature of 15 °C and forest stocking of 500 million were suggested respectively for abrupt changes in ﬁre frequency and burnt area. Climatic conditions generally dominated the variation in human-caused ﬁres, but lightning ﬁres were primarily inﬂuenced by fuel load. However, the most important factors for ﬁre features varied substantially at the provincial scale, highlighting the complexity in the roles of climate or fuel conditions and their combinations for ﬁre risk. Our results provided a ﬁrst ground-based snapshot of forest ﬁre patterns in China at a high spatial resolution, revealed contrasting features of natural- and human-caused forest ﬁres, and highlighted the spatial variation of ﬁre drivers. The potential uncertainty indicated the necessity of long-term monitoring with multiple approaches for better understanding of forest ﬁre activities and optimal practice in forest ﬁre management in China, both at national and provincial scales.},

This increasingly complex ﬁre environment highlights the importance of developing robust tools to support risk-informed decision making. While tools have been developed to aid ﬁre management, few have focused on large-ﬁre management and those that have typically simpliﬁed the decision environment such that they are not operationally relevant. Additionally, ﬁre managers need to be able to evaluate alternative response strategies that lead to tradeoﬀ analyses balancing ﬁre impacts, responder exposure, ﬁnancial and resource investments, and probability of success. In this review, we describe limitations in existing operational research models from the perspective of large ﬁre management decisions. We identify a broader set of objectives, decisions and constraints to be integrated into the next generation operational research models. Including these changes would support evaluation of a suite of response options and the eﬃcient resource packages necessary to achieve response objectives, aiding decision maker’s ability to minimize responder exposure while reducing the social, ecological and economic impacts of wildﬁres. We follow with a proposed framework for expanding current large ﬁre decision support systems, and conclude by brieﬂy highlighting critical research needs and organizational changes necessary to create and implement these tools and overcome the negative consequences of positive feedbacks derived from historical and current wildﬁre management policies and strategies.},

The effectiveness of fuelbreaks remains a subject of debate because of differing fuelbreak objectives, prescriptions for creation and maintenance, and their placement in landscapes with differing ®re regimes. A well-designed fuelbreak will alter the behavior of wildland ®re entering the fuel-altered zone. Both surface and crown ®re behavior may be reduced. Shaded fuelbreaks must be created in the context of the landscape within which they are placed. No absolute standards for fuelbreak width or fuel reduction are possible, although recent proposals for forested fuelbreaks suggest 400 m wide bands where surface fuels are reduced and crown fuels are thinned. Landscape-level treatments such as prescribed ®re can use shaded fuelbreaks as anchor points, and extend the zone of altered ®re behavior to larger proportions of the landscape. Coupling fuelbreaks with area-wide fuel treatments can reduce the size, intensity, and effects of wildland ®res. \# 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The immune system of vertebrate animals reacts to nonself antigens by producing a specific immune response which triggers destruction of the antigen ; it reacts to self antigens by incorporating them into the regulatory dynamics of a self-organizing network. It is argued that this behaviour meets the requirements of the definition, and hence that the immune system is a cognitive entity capable of adaptation, learning and memory. Consequences of this perspective are that the molecules and cells of a multicellular organism are not, as such, "cognitive" ; that the full articulation of neurophysiology into cognitive science requires a study of emergent behaviour at the level of meaningful interactions between a system and its environment ; and that the objects of cognition, with or without neurones, are brought into existence by the coupled perceptions and actions of the cognitive system itself.},

	abstract = {Loss and alteration of breeding habitat have been proposed as causes of declines in several Neotropical migrant bird populations. We conducted a 4-year study to determine the effects of winter prescribed burning and forest thinning on breeding wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) populations at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR) in Georgia. We estimated density, adult and juvenile survival rates, and apparent annual survival using transect surveys, radiotelemetry, and mist netting. Burning and thinning did not cause lower densities (P = 0.25); wood thrush density ranged from 0.15 to 1.30 pairs/l0 ha. No radiomarked male wood thrushes (n = 68) died during the 4 years, but female weekly survival was 0.981 :!: 0.014 (SE) for females (n = 63) and 0.976 :!: 0.010 for juveniles (n = 38). Apparent annual adult survival was 0.579 (SE = 0.173). Thinning and prescribed burning did not reduce adult or juvenile survival during the breeding season or apparent annual adult survival. Annual population growth (\vphantom{\{}\}..) at PNWR was 1.00 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.32-1.63), and the considerable uncertainty in this prediction underscores the need for long-term monitoring to effectively manage Neotropical migrants. Population growth increased on experimental compartments after the burn and thin (95\% CI before = 0.91-0.97, after = 0.98-1.05), while control compartment \vphantom{\{}\}.. declined (before = 0.98-1.05, after = 0.87-0.92). We found no evidence that the current management regime at PNWR, designed to improve red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) habitat, negatively {\textasciitilde}ffected wood thrushes.},

The time-invariant, scale-invariant characteristics of SOC of forest ﬁre in China are analyzed in detail. The deviations between the occurrence frequency of very large ﬁres and the power-law relation are explained by the forest-ﬁre model with tree immunity (FFMTI). Actual forest-ﬁre records are compared with the simulation results of a self-organized critical forest-ﬁre model. It is shown that the forest-ﬁre model applies well to explain the SOC characteristics of a forest ﬁre.

	abstract = {Objective: Our purpose was to establish normal pattems and relationships of stability using the Biodex Stability System. Design and Setting: The design of this study used both nonexperimental and quasi-experimental methods. All testing was performed in a university sports medicine laboratory. Subjects: Nineteen healthy subjects (8 males, 11 females, age = 24.4 ± 4.2 years; wt = 70.5 ± 20 kg; ht = 171.2 ± 11.7 cm) with no history of lower extremity injury participated in this study. Measurements: For data analysis, the mediaVlateral stability index (MLSI), anterior/posterior stability index (APSI), overall stability index (OSI), and time-in-balance scores were recorded. Results: Multiple regression revealed that APSI and MLSI significantly contributed to the OSI, with the APSI accounting for 95\% of the OSI variance. Additionally, the percentage of time spent between 00 and 50 from level was significantly greater than the time spent between 60 and 100, 1 10 and 150, and 160 and 200. Furthermore, the percentage of time spent between 60 and 100 was significantly greater than the time spent between 160 and 200. Conclusions: These data suggest that uninjured individuals spent the majority of the time balanced within 0° to 50 from level and progressively less time at greater angles. Additionally, the data suggest that the OSI is very closely related to the APSI and receives a relatively small contribution from the MLSI. Because of this small contribution, if the clinician is interested in both anterior-posterior and medial-lateral motions, it may be best to use the MLSI and APSI separately rather than the OSI.},

Using model-based multivariate methods, we did not ﬁnd an inﬂuence of prescribed burning on the dung beetle assemblage. We report a negative inﬂuence of vegetation visual obstruction and no signiﬁcant inﬂuence of dung density on dung beetle assemblages. These results suggest that prescribed ﬁre may not negatively affect dung beetle species within the North American Great Plains; however, vegetation structure correlated to postﬁre rangeland environments may inﬂuence local beetle abundance.},

Satellite remote sensing is one of the most cost-eﬀective and comprehensive approaches to identify biodiversity hotspots and predict changes in species composition. This is because, in contrast to ﬁeld-based methods, it allows for complete spatial coverages of the Earth's surface under study over a short period of time. Furthermore, satellite remote sensing provides repeated measures, thus making it possible to study temporal changes in biodiversity. While taxonomic diversity measures have long been established, problems arising from abundance related measures have not been yet disentangled. Moreover, little has been done to account for functional diversity besides taxonomic diversity measures. The aim of this manuscript is to propose robust measures of remotely sensed heterogeneity to perform exploratory analysis for the detection of hotspots of taxonomic and functional diversity of plant species.},

Sustainability as a normative concept captures basic ideas of intergenerational justice when human well-being depends on natural capital and services. Thus, resilience and sustainability are independent concepts. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between resilience and sustainability of ecologicaleconomic systems. We use a simple dynamic model where two natural capital stocks provide ecosystem services that are complements for human well-being, to illustrate different possible cases of the relationship between resilience and sustainability, and to identify the conditions under which each of those will hold: a) resilience of the system is necessary, but not sufﬁcient, for sustainability; b) resilience of the system is sufﬁcient, but not necessary, for sustainability; c) resilience of the system is neither necessary nor sufﬁcient for sustainability; and d) resilience is both necessary and sufﬁcient for sustainability. We conclude that more criteria than just resilience have to be taken into account when designing policies for the sustainable development of ecological-economic systems, and, vice versa, the property of resilience should not be confused with the positive normative connotations of sustainability.},

In the southeastern United States, decreased frequency of both fires and hurricanes with global warming will shift pine savannas toward a forested state. A CO2 fertilization effect that increases the growth rate of tree populations will also push southeastern landscapes from open savannas towards closed forests. Transient dynamics associated with climate driven changes in vegetation will last on the order of decades to a century. In our model, the sensitivity of savannas to relative changes in the frequency of fire versus hurricanes is linearly dependent on the growth rate and mortality of trees in fire and hurricane disturbances.},

Rate constants were determined by fitting models to data with an analog computer. Simulations with the models permitted comparisons of different microcosms in terms of time to radiocesium equilibrium, steady state concentrations, concentration factors, input and output fluxes, turnover rates, and stability. Rate constants varied with different compartment combinations, indicating both qualitative and quantitative differences in the cesium exchange patterns within different systems. This result is generalized: transfers of energy and matter in ecosystems are functions of networks which define intercompartmental interactions; internal coupling should be considered a significant variable in investigations of ecosystem processes. Points of particular interest derived from the computer simulations are (i) organism concentration factors for a material may vary in different systems, depending upon how the organism is coupled to other compartments; (ii) total flux of a material in a steady state system may vary considerably from that in another system which receives identical input; (iii) material turnover within compartments and in the system as a whole tends to increase as more compartments are added; and (iv) stability of material concentration does not appear to increase with system complexity.},

	abstract = {Savanna ecosystems are characterized by the co-occurrence of trees and grasses. In this paper, we argue that the balance between trees and grasses is, to a large extent, determined by the indirect interactive effects of herbivory and fire. These effects are based on the positive feedback between fuel load (grass biomass) and fire intensity. An increase in the level of grazing leads to reduced fuel load, which makes fire less intense and, thus, less damaging to trees and, consequently, results in an increase in woody vegetation. The system then switches from a state with trees and grasses to a state with solely trees. Similarly, browsers may enhance the effect of fire on trees because they reduce woody biomass, thus indirectly stimulating grass growth. This consequent increase in fuel load results in more intense fire and increased decline of biomass. The system then switches from a state with solely trees to a state with trees and grasses. We maintain that the interaction between fire and herbivory provides a mechanistic explanation for observed discontinuous changes in woody and grass biomass. This is an alternative for the soil degradation mechanism, in which there is a positive feedback between the amount of grass biomass and the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil. The soil degradation mechanism predicts no discontinuous changes, such as bush encroachment, on sandy soils. Such changes, however, are frequently observed. Therefore, the interactive effects of fire and herbivory provide a more plausible explanation for the occurrence of discontinuous changes in savanna ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Savannas commonly consist of a discontinuous cover of overstory trees and a groundcover of grasses. Savanna models have previously demonstrated that vegetation feedbacks on ﬁre frequency can limit the density of overstory trees, thereby maintaining savannas. Positive feedbacks of either savanna trees alone or trees and grasses together on ﬁre frequency have been shown to result in a stable savanna equilibrium. Grass feedbacks on ﬁre frequency, in contrast, have resulted in stable equilibria in either a grassland or forest state, but not in a savanna. These results, however, were derived from a system of differential equations that assumes that ﬁre occurrence is strictly deterministic and that vegetation losses due to ﬁre are continuous in time. We develop an alternative formulation of the grass-ﬁre feedback model that assumes that ﬁres are discrete and occur stochastically in time to examine the inﬂuence of these assumptions on the predicted state of the system. We show that incorporating ﬁre as a discrete event can produce a recurring temporal refuge in which both grass and trees co-occur in a stable, bounded savanna. In our model, tree abundance is limited without invoking demographic bottlenecks in the transition from ﬁre-sensitive to ﬁre-resistant life history stages. An increasing strength of grass feedback on ﬁre results in regular, predictable ﬁres, which suggests that the system can also be modeled using a set of difference equations. We implement this discrete system using modiﬁed Leslie/Gower difference equations and demonstrate the existence of a bounded savanna state in this model framework. Our results conﬁrm the potential for grass feedbacks to result in stable savannas, and indicate the importance of modeling ﬁre as a discrete event rather than as a loss rate that is continuous in time.},

	abstract = {Assessing ecosystem health is an ongoing priority for governments, scientists and managers worldwide. There are several decades of scientiﬁc literature discussing ecosystem health and approaches to assess it, with applications to aquatic and terrestrial environments incorporating economic, environmental and social processes. We conducted a systematic review of studies that assess ecosystem health to update our current understanding of how ecosystem health is being deﬁned, and provide new ideas and directions on how it can be measured. We focused the review on studies that used the term ‘ecosystem health’ or the equivalent terms ‘ecosystem integrity’, ‘ecosystem quality’ and ‘ecosystem protection’, in lotic freshwater and estuarine environments, and examined how many of these included explicit deﬁnitions of what ecosystem health means for their study system. We collected information about the temporal and geographical distribution of studies, and the types of indicators (biological, physical or chemical) used in the assessments. We found few studies clearly deﬁned ecosystem health and justiﬁed the choice of indicators. Given the broad use of the term it seems impractical to have an overarching deﬁnition of ecosystem health, but rather an approach that is able to deﬁne and measure health on a case by case basis. A combination of biological, physical and chemical indicators was commonly used to assess ecosystem health in both estuarine and freshwater studies, with a strong bias towards ﬁsh and macroinvertebrate community metrics (e.g. diversity, abundance and composition). We found only two studies that simultaneously considered both freshwater and estuarine sections of the ecosystem, highlighting the signiﬁcant knowledge gap in our understanding of the transfer of ﬂow, nutrients and biota between the different systems—all key factors that inﬂuence ecosystem health. This review is the ﬁrst to combine knowledge from both freshwater and estuarine ecosystem assessments and critically review how aquatic ecosystem health is deﬁned and measured since the late-1990s, providing the basis for setting achievable management goals relating to ecosystem health into the future.},

Ecosystem health represents a desired endpoint of environmental management, but it requires adaptive, ongoing deﬁnition and assessment. We propose that a healthy ecosystem is one that is sustainable – that is, it has the ability to maintain its structure (organization) and function (vigor) over time in the face of external stress (resilience). Various methods to quantify these three ecosystem attributes (vigor, organization, and resilience) are discussed. These attributes are then folded into a comprehensive assessment of ecosystem health. A network analysis based ecosystem health assessment is developed and tested using trophic exchange networks representing several different aquatic ecosystems. Results indicate the potential of such an ecosystem health assessment for evaluating the relative health of similar ecosystems, and quantifying the effects of natural or anthropogenic stress on the health of a particular ecosystem over time.},

Within three decades, fine fuel on the ground reached 0.6 to 0.9 kg⋅m–2 and was thereafter fairly constant at this level. In the youngest stands this fuel consisted mainly of litter from the tree canopy, whereas in the oldest stands, pleurocarpous mosses made up the majority of the load. The expansion of pleurocarpous mosses from around year 20 resulted in a shift towards a deeper and less compact fuel bed. Simulations using the Rothermel fire spread model predicted no or minimal fire spread in stands younger than 25 years, and this was corroborated by a number of unsuccessful ignitions on recently burnt sites. We suggest three phases in postfire succession with respect to fire propagation and surface fire intensity: (1) up to about 20 years after fire, no or marginal fire spread; (2) between years 20 and 50 a progressive rise in potential fire intensity; (3) from around year 50 a steady state in potential fire intensity. By setting a limit for the shortest possible fire intervals, this pattern of fuel accumulation might have a significant effect on fire frequencies in the landscape.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon called “flashover” or “eruptive fire” in forest fires is characterized by a sudden change in fire behavior: everything seems to burst into flames instantly and firefighters are overwhelmed by a sort of eruption, spreading at a speed at far several meters per second. Unfortunately it has cost several lives in the past. The reasons for such an accident always create controversy in the research field. Different theories are highlighted and especially two major axes are currently subject to discussion because they are very popular among people involved in firefighting. The one with regard to VOCs emissions is the best-known among firemen. Under great heat, during summer or with a fire approaching, plants emit VOCs and the more the temperature grows, the more the amount of VOCs emitted grows. Under specific conditions (essentially topographical, meteorological and atmospheric), the cloud of gas can accumulate in an appropriate zone. The concentration of VOCs may therefore reach the Lower Explosive Limit, triggering the burst of the cloud when in contact with the fire. The second theory depends on physical considerations. An example is based on a convective flow created by the fire itself. When a fire spreads on a slope, it creates an aspiration phenomenon in a way to supply the fire with oxygen. The more this phenomenon is important, the more the flames tilt and increase the rate of speed, needing even more oxygen and thus induced flow. This vicious circle can stabilize or have an erratic behavior to trigger off a fire eruption. This article presents these two theories, and especially the new advances on this research subject.},

Prescribed burning in ponderosa pine forests 1–9 years before the Rodeo and Chediski fires reduced fire severity compared with untreated areas, despite the unprecedented 1860-km2 combined wildfire sizes and record drought. Fire severity increased with time since treatment but decreased with unit size and number of repeated prescribed burn treatments. Fire progression captured by Landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) clearly showed the fire circumventing treatment units and protecting areas on their lee side. This evidence is consistent with model predictions that suggest wildland fire size and severity can be mitigated by strategic placement of treatments.},

The study area is a mixed-evergreen forest of southwestern Oregon with a mixed-severity fire regime.

The potential for crown fire initiation remained fairly constant despite reductions in ladder fuels, because thinning increased surface fuels, which contributed to greater surface fire intensity. Thinning followed by underburning reduced canopy, ladder, and surface fuels, thereby decreasing surface fire intensity and crown fire potential. However, crown fire is not a prerequisite for high fire severity; damage to and mortality of overstory trees in the wildfire were extensive despite the absence of crown fire. Mortality was most severe in thinned treatments (80\%–100\%), moderate in untreated stands (53\%–54\%), and least severe in the thinned and underburned treatment (5\%). Thinned treatments had higher fine-fuel loading and more extensive crown scorch, suggesting that greater consumption of fine fuels contributed to higher tree mortality. Fuel treatments intended to minimize tree mortality will be most effective if both ladder and surface fuels are treated.},

The Angora Fire burned at unusually high severity due to heavy fuels; strong winds; warm, dry weather; and unseasonably low fuel moistures. The ﬁre destroyed 254 homes, and ﬁnal loss and suppression cost estimates of \$160,000,000 make the Angora Fire one of the ten costliest wildﬁres in US history. The Angora Fire burned into 194 ha of fuel treatments intended to modify ﬁre behavior and protect private and public assets in the Angora Creek watershed. The ﬁre thus provides a unique opportunity to quantitatively assess the effects of fuel treatments on wildﬁre severity in an area of wildland–urban interface. We measured ﬁre effects on vegetation in treated and adjacent untreated areas within the Angora Fire perimeter, immediately after and one year after the ﬁre. Our measures of ﬁre severity included tree mortality; height of bole char, crown scorch, and crown torch; and percent crown scorch and torch. Unlike most studies of fuel treatment effectiveness, our study design included replication and implicitly controlled for variation in topography and weather. Our results show that fuel treatments generally performed as designed and substantially changed ﬁre behavior and subsequent ﬁre effects to forest vegetation. Exceptions include two treatment units where slope steepness led to lower levels of fuels removal due to local standards for erosion prevention. Hand-piled fuels in one of these two units had also not yet been burned. Excepting these units, bole char height and ﬁre effects to the forest canopy (measured by crown scorching and torching) were signiﬁcantly lower, and tree survival signiﬁcantly higher, within sampled treatments than outside them. In most cases, crown ﬁre behavior changed to surface ﬁre within 50 m of encountering a fuel treatment. The Angora Fire underlines the important role that properly implemented fuel treatments can play in protecting assets, reducing ﬁre severity and increasing forest resilience.},

	abstract = {Multi-temporal change detection is commonly used in the detection of changes to ecosystems. Differencing single band indices derived from multispectral pre- and post-fire images is one of the most frequently used change detection algorithms. In this paper we examine a commonly used index used in mapping fire effects due to wildland fire. Subtracting a post-fire from a pre-fire image derived index produces a measure of absolute change which then can be used to estimate total carbon release, biomass loss, smoke production, etc. Measuring absolute change however, may be inappropriate when assessing ecological impacts. In a pixel with a sparse tree canopy for example, differencing a vegetation index will measure a small change due stand-replacing fire. Similarly, differencing will produce a large change value in a pixel experiencing stand-replacing fire that had a dense pre-fire tree canopy. If all stand-replacing fire is defined as severe fire, then thresholding an absolute change image derived through image differencing to produce a categorical classification of burn severity can result in misclassification of low vegetated pixels. Misclassification of low vegetated pixels also happens when classifying severity in different vegetation types within the same fire perimeter with one set of thresholds. Comparisons of classifications derived from thresholds of dNBR and relative dNBR data for individual fires may result in similar classification accuracies. However, classifications of relative dNBR data can produce higher accuracies on average for the high burn severity category than dNBR classifications derived from a universal set of thresholds applied across multiple fires. This is important when mapping historic fires where precise field based severity data may not be available to aid in classification. Implementation of a relative index will also allow a more direct comparison of severity between fires across space and time which is important for landscape level analysis. In this paper we present a relative version of dNBR based upon field data from 14 fires in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California, USA. The methods presented may have application to other types of disturbance events.},

Treatments modeled included prescribed burn, pile and burn, cut and scatter, thinning and biomass, thinning and biomass followed by prescribed burn, and salvage or group selection harvest with and without slash and landscape-level fuel treatment. The prescribed burn, thinning and biomassing followed by prescribed burn, and salvage or group selection with slash and landscape fuel treatments resulted in the lowest average fireline intensities, heat per unit area, rate of spread, area burned, and scorch heights. Cut and scatter, salvage or group selection treatments that do not treat slash fuels resulted in fire behaviour that is more extreme than the untreated forest. Restoration of mixed-conifer ecosystems must include an examination of how proposed treatments affect fuel structures. Combinations of prescribed fire andror mechanical treatments can be used to reduce wildfire hazard. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

This paper presents information from a replicated, stand level experiment from mixed conifer forests in the north-central Sierra Nevada that investigated how control, mechanical (crown thinning, thinning from below followed, rotary mastication), prescribed ﬁre, and mechanical followed by prescribed ﬁre treatments affected fuels, forest structure, potential ﬁre behavior, and modeled tree mortality at 80th, 90th, and 97.5th percentile ﬁre weather conditions. Fuels Management Analyst was used to model ﬁre behavior and tree mortality. Thinning and mastication each reduced crown bulk density by approximately 19\% in mechanical only and mechanical plus ﬁre treatments. Prescribed burning signiﬁcantly reduced the total combined fuel load of litter, duff, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 h fuels by as much as 90\%. This reduction signiﬁcantly altered modeled ﬁre behavior in both mechanical plus ﬁre and ﬁre only treatments in terms of ﬁreline intensity and predicted mortality. The prescribed ﬁre only and mechanical followed by prescribed ﬁre treatments resulted in the lowest average ﬁreline intensities, rate of spread, and predicted mortality. The control treatment resulted in the most severe modeled ﬁre behavior and tree mortality. Mechanical only treatments were an improvement over controls but still resulted in tree mortality at severe ﬁre weather when compared with the treatments that included prescribed ﬁre. Restoration of mixed conifer ecosystems must include an examination of how proposed treatments affect ﬁre behavior and effects. Variation in existing stand structures will require solutions that are site speciﬁc but the principals outlined in this work should help managers make better decisions. \# 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Land managers are mandated to protect the ecological integrity and health of the lands they manage. Based on research identifying fire as a keystone natural process within the Sierra Nevada in California, restoring fire in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks has been an important management goal. A Geographic Information System (GIS) based “ecological need model” was developed to provide an index to rank areas in the parks based on the need to restore historic fire regimes. Inputs to the ecological need model included: (1) vegetation class; (2) historic (preEuroamerican settlement) fire return intervals for each vegetation class; and (3) fire perimeters from the known historic fire records (1921-present). Using these inputs, a derived index was calculated to quantify the departure of an area from its preEuroamerican settlement fire return interval. An index value greater than 0 indicates the number of historic fire return intervals that an area has missed. A negative number indicates that an area has burned within its historic fire return interval. The index values were divided into four categories of ecological need: low, moderate, high, and extreme. These categories were then mapped spatially across the parks using GIS. Fire Return Interval Departure (FRID) maps are updated annually as new fires (prescribed and wildland) occur. This model complements more traditional models based on fire hazard and ignition risk that are essential to sound fire management planning. The FRID model is a dynamic and valuable decision support tool that integrates ecological information to prioritize areas for initial treatment with prescribed fire, assist with scheduling successive burns, help provide economic accountability, and evaluate progress towards achieving landscape-level ecological goals.},

Wilderness fire management requires balancing mandates to both preserve natural conditions and minimize the impacts of human activities. It also requires consideration of ecological and social values both within and outside of wilderness. In many wilderness and similarly protected areas, decades of fire exclusion have resulted in conditions of unnatural vegetation and fuel accumulation. Resulting fires are increasingly of sizes and intensities unprecedented in fire history records. Although current federal interagency fire policy facilitates the use of natural ignitions (wildland fire use for resource benefits) to restore more natural fire regimes, concerns about damage to natural resources, smoke impacts on surrounding communities, and threats to life and property on adjacent lands result in the suppression of most natural ignitions occurring within wilderness. In addition, natural ignitions outside of wilderness that would otherwise burn into wilderness are commonly suppressed before they reach the wilderness boundary.},

	abstract = {Aim Patterns of fire regimes across Australia exhibit biogeographic variation in response to four processes. Variations in area burned and fire frequency result from differences in the rates of ‘switching’ of biomass growth, availability to burn, fire weather and ignition. Therefore differing processes limit fire (i.e. the lowest rate of switching) in differing ecosystems. Current and future trends in fire frequency were explored on this basis. Location Case studies of forests (cool temperate to tropical) and woodlands (temperate to arid) were examined. These represent a broad range of Australian biomes and current fire regimes. Methods Information on the four processes was applied to each case study and the potential minimum length of interfire interval was predicted and compared to current trends. The potential effects of global change on the processes were then assessed and future trends in fire regimes were predicted. Results Variations in fire regimes are primarily related to fluctuations in available moisture and dominance by either woody or herbaceous plant cover. Fire in woodland communities (dry climates) is limited by growth of herbaceous fuels (biomass), whereas in forests (wet climates) limitation is by fuel moisture (availability to burn) and fire weather. Increasing dryness in woodland communities will decrease potential fire frequency, while the opposite applies in forests. In the tropics, both forms of limitation are weak due to the annual wet/dry climate. Future change may therefore be constrained. Main conclusions Increasing dryness may diminish fire activity over much of Australia (dominance of dry woodlands), though increases may occur in temperate forests. Elevated CO2 effects may confound or reinforce these trends. The prognosis for the future fire regime in Australia is therefore uncertain.},

We quantiﬁed the structure (e.g., composition, age, and size) of old-growth mixed conifer stands located across a range of environmental settings. Fire histories were reconstructed using ﬁre-scar dendrochronology, and the inﬂuence of regional climatic variability on ﬁre occurrence was assessed by relating the ﬁre record to regional climate reconstructions. Fire regimes parameters varied across topographic gradients at landscape scales promoting ﬁne grain forest structural patterns. The timing and extent of ﬁres was related to inter-annual and inter-decadal variation in drought which was linked to the El Nin˜oSouthern Oscillation and the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation. Coarse scale vegetation patterns where related to upper slope positions and relatively infrequent high severity ﬁres. Fire regimes and forest structure have changed since EuroAmerican settlement with virtually no ﬁres and structural shifts towards higher stand densities and a greater representation of ﬁre intolerant species. At the landscape scale, ﬁre regimes and forests patterns in mixed conifer forests are inﬂuenced by a variety of process operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Coarse scale heterogeneity related to topography and moderate to high severity ﬁre is superimposed on ﬁne scale variability related to topographic gradients and local variability in fuel and forest structural characteristics. Fire suppression has resulted in a more homogenous landscape particularly with regard to the loss of coarse scale heterogeneity.},

We evaluated the extent to which areas treated under the NFP – from 2004 to 2008, in forest ecosystems outside the wildland–urban interface in 11 western states (“West”) – were predicted to need restoration, due to disruption of fire regimes and expected fuels buildup. Fuel-reduction treatments were implemented on about 1\% of the West's forested areas. Forty-three percent of the treated area was predicted to have high-restoration need – almost twice as much as expected, given the distribution of these forests. However, an equal amount was in mixed- or uncertain-need forests, and 14\% occurred in low-need forests, suggesting that managers need additional information on fire-regime disruptions in some forest ecosystems to help prioritize restoration activities. Only one-quarter of the West's forested area shows strong evidence of uncharacteristic fuels buildup, which is often emphasized as the primary cause of current wildfire problems, potentially directing attention away from other important drivers such as climate change and an expanding wildland–urban interface.},

In the summer of 2010, we examined giant sequoia regeneration in four groves subjected to: 1) moderate- to high-severity wildfire in 1987 (Case Mountain, Redwood Mountain groves), 2) low-severity wildfire in 2008 (Black Mountain grove), 3) retention harvest (removal of all trees except large-diameter giant sequoia) followed by prescribed burning in the mid-1980s (Black Mountain, Bearskin groves), and 4) nearby unburned and unharvested (control) stands in all groves. Density of giant sequoia regeneration was greater in the moderate- and high-severity wildfire stands than control stands, but there was no difference in giant sequoia regeneration between low-severity burned and control stands. Stands thinned by retention harvest and prescribed burning had greater giant sequoia regeneration than control stands. Across all control and low- to moderate-severity wildfire stands, giant sequoia regeneration was positively associated with canopy gaps. In wildfire and retention harvest stands, giant sequoia regeneration was positively associated with distance to gap edge, direct and indirect solar radiation, and soil moisture. Our results corroborate previous studies in finding that giant sequoia regeneration benefits from fire. Both wildfire and prescribed fire (preceded by harvest or not) can serve to promote giant sequoia regeneration, providing that fire intensity is sufficient to create canopy gaps, increase understory light, and remove surface litter.},

The model simulates a spatially heterogeneous fuel bed that is responsive to changes in forest condition, making it well suited for examining alternative management approaches for restoring Sierra Nevada forests after a century of ﬁre exclusion. Presuppression forest basal area, species composition, and spatial autocorrelation structure were restored quickly, if simulated disturbances that caused substantial tree mortality were reintroduced.

	abstract = {Forests characterized by mixed-severity ﬁres occupy a broad moisture gradient between lower elevation forests typiﬁed by low-severity ﬁres and higher elevation forests in which high-severity, stand replacing ﬁres are the norm. Mixed-severity forest types are poorly documented and little understood but likely occupy signiﬁcant areas in the western United States. By deﬁnition, mixed-severity types have high beta diversity at meso-scales, encompassing patches of both high and low severity and gradients in between. Studies of mixed-severity types reveal complex landscapes in which patch sizes follow a power law distribution with many small and few large patches. Forest types characterized by mixed severity can be classiﬁed according to the modal proportion of high to low severity patches, which increases from relatively dry to relatively mesic site conditions. Mixed-severity regimes are produced by interactions between top-down forcing by climate and bottom-up shaping by topography and the ﬂammability of vegetation, although speciﬁc effects may vary widely across the region, especially the relation between aspect and ﬁre severity. History is important in shaping ﬁre behavior in mixed-severity landscapes, as patterns laid down by previous ﬁres can play a signiﬁcant role in shaping future ﬁres. Like low-severity forests in the western United States, many dry mixed-severity types experienced signiﬁcant increases in stand density during the 20th century, threatening forest health and biodiversity, however not all understory development in mixed-severity forests increases the threat of severe wild ﬁres. In general, current landscapes have been homogenized, reducing beta diversity and increasing the probability of large ﬁres and insect outbreaks. Further loss of old, ﬁre tolerant trees is of particular concern, but understory diversity has been reduced as well. High stand densities on relatively dry sites increase water use and therefore susceptibility to drought and insect outbreaks, exacerbating a trend of increasing regional drying. The need to restore beta diversity while protecting habitat for closed-forest specialists such as the northern spotted owl call for landscape-level approaches to ecological restoration.},

Results Slope aspect, potential soil moisture, forest composition, and fire regime parameters in our study area co-vary. Median composite and point fire return intervals (FRI) were longest on higher, cooler, more mesic, north-facing (NF) slopes covered with white fir (Abies concolor), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)-white fir, and red fir (A. magnifica)-white fir forests, shortest on the dry, south-facing (SF) slopes covered with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-white fir forests and intermediate on west-facing slopes dominated by white fir-sugar pine (P. lambertiana)-incense cedar (Libocedrus decurrens) forests. The spatial pattern for length of fire rotation (FR) was the same as that for FRI. Fires in CCRNA mixed conifer forests occurred mainly (90\%) in the dormant season. Size of burns in CCRNA mixed conifer forests were generally small (mean = 106 ha), however, during certain drought years widespread fires burned across fuel breaks and spread throughout the watershed. Fire severity was mainly high on upper slopes, low on lower slopes and moderate and low severity on middle slopes. Patterns of fire severity also varied with slope aspect. Fire frequency decreased dramatically in CCRNA after 1905.
Conclusions In CCRNA, fire regime parameters [e.g. FRI, fire extent, FR, fire severity] varied widely with species composition, slope aspect and slope position. There was also temporal variation in fire extent with the most widespread fires occurring during drought years. The important contributions of topography and climate to variation in the fire regime indicates that exogenous factors play a key role in shaping the fire-forest structure mosaic and that the fire-forest structure mosaic is more variable, less predictable and less stable than previously thought. Finally, some characteristics of the fire regime (i.e. fire severity, season of burn) in CCRNA are different than those described for other mixed conifer forests and this suggests that there are geographical differences in mixed conifer fire regimes along the Pacific slope.},

	abstract = {Burn severity can be mapped using satellite data to detect changes in forest structure and moisture content caused by fires. The 2001 Leroux fire on the Coconino National Forest, Arizona, burned over 18 preexisting permanent 0.1 ha plots. Plots were re-measured following the fire. Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery and the Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio ( NBR) were used to map the fire into four severity levels immediately following the fire (July 2001) and 1 year after the fire (June 2002). Ninety-two Composite Burn Index (CBI) plots were compared to the fire severity maps. Pre- and post-fire plot measurements were also analysed according to their imagery classification. Ground measurements demonstrated differences in forest structure. Areas that were classified as severely burned on the imagery were predominantly Pinus ponderosa stands. Tree density and basal area, snag density and fine fuel accumulation were associated with severity levels. Tree mortality was not greatest in severely burned areas, indicating that the NBR is comprehensive in rating burn severity by incorporating multiple forest strata. While the NBR was less accurate at mapping perimeters, the method was reliable for mapping severely burned areas that may need immediate or long-term post-fire recovery.},

	abstract = {The frequency, extent, and severity of ®res strongly in¯uence development patterns of forests dominated by Douglas-®r in the Paci®c Northwest. Limited data on ®re history and stand structure suggest that there is geographical variation in ®re regimes and that this variation contributes to regional differences in stand and landscape structure. Managers need region-speci®c ®re regime data to develop process-based management schemes to manage new late-successional reserves (LSR). This study quanti®es ®re regimes and stand structural patterns in a LSR in Douglas-®r-dominated forests in northern California. We analyzed tree species composition, structure (diameter, age), and ®re scars from 75 plots in a 1570 ha area in the northern Klamath Mountains. Tree species composition varied with elevation and aspect, and median ®re return intervals were similar (12±19 years) among species composition groups. However, median ®re return intervals (FRI) were shorter on south- (8 years) and west-facing (13 years) slopes than on northern (15 years) or eastern (16.5 years) aspects. Fire return intervals also varied by historical period. Median FRIs were longer (21.8 years) during the suppression period (1905±1992) than in the settlement (1850±1904) (12.5 years) or presettlement (1627±1849) (14.5 years) period. The average burn area for a ®re was 350 ha, and 16 ®res larger than 500 ha burned between 1627 and 1992. Fire rotations varied by century from 15.5 to 25.5 years and were longest in the ®re suppression period. Stand conditions were multi-aged, and Douglas-®r recruitment occurred after ®re. Patterns of past ®re severity, inferred from age-classes, indicate that upper slopes, ridgetops, and south- and west-facing slopes experienced more severe ®res between 1850 and 1950 than lower slopes or east- and north-facing slopes. Implications are that lower slopes and north and east aspects are more likely than other topographic positions to sustain or promote long-term, latesuccessional conditions. Prescribed ®re will likely be an integral component of management plans that successfully maintain natural processes and structures in newly established late-successional reserves in the Klamath Mountains. \# 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Climatic variability is a dominant factor affecting large wildfires in the western United States, an observation supported by palaeoecological data on charcoal in lake sediments and reconstructions from fire-scarred trees. Although current fire management focuses on fuel reductions to bring fuel loadings back to their historical ranges, at the regional scale extreme fire weather is still the dominant influence on area burned and fire severity. Current forecasting tools are limited to short-term predictions of fire weather, but increased understanding of large-scale oceanic and atmospheric patterns in the Pacific Ocean (e.g., El Nin˜o Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation) may improve our ability to predict climatic variability at seasonal to annual leads. Associations between these quasi-periodic patterns and fire occurrence, though evident in some regions, have been difficult to establish in others. Increased temperature in the future will likely extend fire seasons throughout the western United States, with more fires occurring earlier and later than is currently typical, and will increase the total area burned in some regions. If climatic change increases the amplitude and duration of extreme fire weather, we can expect significant changes in the distribution and abundance of dominant plant species in some ecosystems, which would thus affect habitat of some sensitive plant and animal species. Some species that are sensitive to fire may decline, whereas the distribution and abundance of species favored by fire may be enhanced. The effects of climatic change will partially depend on the extent to which resource management modifies vegetation structure and fuels.},

	abstract = {In temperate Australia, wildfires are predicted to be more frequent and severe under climate change. This could lead to marked changes in tree mortality and regeneration in the region’s predominant eucalypt forests, which have been burned repeatedly by extensive wildfires in the period 2003–14. Recent studies have applied alternative stable state models to select ‘fire sensitive’ forest types, but comparable models have not been rigorously examined in relation to the more extensive ‘fire tolerant’ forests in the region. We review the effects of increasing wildfire frequency on tree mortality and regeneration in temperate forests of Victoria, south-eastern Australia, based on the functional traits of the dominant eucalypts: those that are typically killed by wildfire to regenerate from seed (‘obligate seeders’) and those that mostly survive to resprout (‘resprouters’). In Victoria, over 4.3 million ha of eucalypt forest has been burned by wildfire in the last decade (2003–14), roughly equivalent to the cumulative area burned in the previous 50 years (1952–2002; 4.4 million ha). This increased wildfire activity has occurred regardless of several advancements in fire management, and has resulted in over 350 000 ha of eucalypt forest being burned twice or more by wildfire at short (≤11 year) intervals. Historical and recent evidence indicates that recurrent wildfires threaten the persistence of the ‘fire sensitive’ obligate seeder eucalypt forests, which can facilitate a shift to non-forest states if successive fires occur within the trees’ primary juvenile period (1–20 years). Our review also highlights potential for structural and state changes in the ‘fire tolerant’ resprouter forests, particularly if recurrent severe wildfires kill seedlings and increase tree mortality. We present conceptual models of state changes in temperate eucalypt forests with increasing wildfire frequency, and highlight knowledge gaps relating to the development and persistence of alternative states driven by changes in fire regimes.},

	abstract = {Forest-ﬁre policy of U.S. federal agencies has evolved from the use of small patrols in newly created National Parks to diverse policy initiatives and institutional arrangements that affect millions of hectares of forests. Even with large expenditures and substantial infrastructure dedicated to ﬁre suppression, the annual area burned by wildﬁre has increased over the last decade. Given the current and future challenges of ﬁre management, and based on analytical research and review of existing policies and their implications, we believe several changes and re-emphases in existing policy are warranted. Most importantly, the actual goal of fuels-management projects should be the reduction of potential ﬁre behavior and effects, not the simple reduction of fuels. To improve safety and economic efﬁciency, ﬁre-suppression policies should recognize differences in the characteristics of wildﬁres, and strategies should be tailored to better respond to the unique demands of each ﬁre. Where forest ﬁres are burning large areas, as in the western United States, reducing the trend of increased amounts of burned area may require a diversity of treatments, including prescribed burning, mechanical fuels treatment, and increased use of the Wildland Fire Use Policy. Assessment of how ﬁre is affecting forests would be enhanced if land-management agencies reported the area burned by low-, mixed-, and high-severity ﬁre and what proportion is outside the desired trend or range of conditions for each forest type. Congress should provide an improved budgetary process for ﬁre and fuels management, with a larger annual federal ﬁre-suppression budget. Additionally, reducing annual area burned will require long-term coordinated efforts by federal and state governments, with robust partnerships between land-management agencies and the public in collaborative planning and stewardship. Research and adaptive management are essential in allowing ﬁre-hazard-reduction projects to move forward where proposed projects are met with uncertainty and mistrust. While legislative reform may be desirable, a strategy that is not entirely dependent on new legislation is needed. Building on existing programs that are consistent with a science-based strategy will enable land-management agencies to better utilize information in pursuit of the overall objective of reducing uncharacteristically severe wildﬁres.},

	abstract = {Pin˜ on–juniper is a major vegetation type in western North America. Effective management of these ecosystems has been hindered by inadequate understanding of 1) the variability in ecosystem structure and ecological processes that exists among the diverse combinations of pin˜ ons, junipers, and associated shrubs, herbs, and soil organisms; 2) the prehistoric and historic disturbance regimes; and 3) the mechanisms driving changes in vegetation structure and composition during the past 150 yr. This article summarizes what we know (and don’t know) about three fundamentally different kinds of pin˜ on–juniper vegetation. Persistent woodlands are found where local soils, climate, and disturbance regimes are favorable for pin˜ on, juniper, or a mix of both; fires have always been infrequent in these woodlands. Pin˜ on–juniper savannas are found where local soils and climate are suitable for both trees and grasses; it is logical that low-severity fires may have maintained low tree densities before disruption of fire regimes following Euro-American settlement, but information is insufficient to support any confident statements about historical disturbance regimes in these savannas. Wooded shrublands are found where local soils and climate support a shrub community, but trees can increase during moist climatic conditions and periods without disturbance and decrease during droughts and following disturbance. Dramatic increases in tree density have occurred in portions of all three types of pin˜ on–juniper vegetation, although equally dramatic mortality events have also occurred in some areas. The potential mechanisms driving increases in tree density—such as recovery from past disturbance, natural range expansion, livestock grazing, fire exclusion, climatic variability, and CO2 fertilization—generally have not received enough empirical or experimental investigation to predict which is most important in any given location. The intent of this synthesis is 1) to provide a source of information for managers and policy makers; and 2) to stimulate researchers to address the most important unanswered questions.},

However, little is known of the ecological impacts of large fires on both historical and contemporary landscapes. The present paper presents a review of the current knowledge of the effects of large fires in the United States by important ecosystems written by regional experts. The ecosystems are (1) ponderosa pine–Douglas-fir, (2) sagebrush–grasslands, (3) piñon–juniper, (4) chaparral, (5) mixed-conifer, and (6) spruce–fir. This review found that large fires were common on most historical western US landscapes and they will continue to be common today with exceptions. Sagebrush ecosystems are currently experiencing larger, more severe, and more frequent large fires compared to historical conditions due to exotic cheatgrass invasions. Historical large fires in south-west ponderosa pine forest created a mixed severity mosaic dominated by non-lethal surface fires while today’s large fires are mostly high severity crown fires. While large fires play an important role in landscape ecology for most regions, their importance is much less in the dry piñon–juniper forests and sagebrush–grasslands. Fire management must address the role of large fires in maintaining the health of many US fire-dominated ecosystems.},

Computer simulation, case studies, and analysis of the fire regime in the presence of active prescribed burning programs in forest and shrubland generally indicate that this fuel management tool facilitates fire suppression efforts by reducing the intensity, size and damage of wildfires. However, the conclusions that can be drawn from the above approaches are limited, highlighting the need for more properly designed experiments addressing this question. Fuel accumulation rate frequently limits prescribed fire effectiveness to a short post-treatment period (2–4 years). Optimisation of the spatial pattern of fire application is critical but has been poorly addressed by research, and practical management guidelines are lacking to initiate this. Furthermore, adequate treatment efforts in terms of fire protection are constrained by operational, social and ecological issues. The best results of prescribed fire application are likely to be attained in heterogeneous landscapes and in climates where the likelihood of extreme weather conditions is low. Conclusive statements concerning the hazard-reduction potential of prescribed fire are not easily generalised, and will ultimately depend on the overall efficiency of the entire fire management process.},

We assembled a spatial database of fuel breaks and ﬁres from the last 30 years in four southern California national forests to better understand which factors are consistently important for fuel breaks in the control of large ﬁres. We also explored which landscape features inﬂuence where ﬁres and fuel breaks are most likely to intersect. The relative importance of signiﬁcant factors explaining fuel break outcome and number of ﬁre and fuel break intersections varied among the forests, which reﬂects high levels of regional landscape diversity. Nevertheless, several factors were consistently important across all the forests. In general, fuel breaks played an important role in controlling large ﬁres only when they facilitated ﬁre management, primarily by providing access for ﬁreﬁghting activities. Fire weather and fuel break maintenance were also consistently important. Models and maps predicting where fuel breaks and ﬁres are most likely to intersect performed well in the regions where the models were developed, but these models did not extend well to other regions, reﬂecting how the environmental controls of ﬁre regimes vary even within a single ecoregion. Nevertheless, similar mapping methods could be adopted in different landscapes to help with strategic location of fuel breaks. Strategic location of fuel breaks should also account for access points near communities, where ﬁre protection is most important.},

Both prescribed fire and its mechanical surrogates are generally successful in meeting short-term fuel-reduction objectives such that treated stands are more resilient to high-intensity wildfire. Most available evidence suggests that these objectives are typically accomplished with few unintended consequences, since most ecosystem components (vegetation, soils, wildlife, bark beetles, carbon sequestration) exhibit very subtle effects or no measurable effects at all. Although mechanical treatments do not serve as complete surrogates for fire, their application can help mitigate costs and liability in some areas. Desired treatment effects on fire hazards are transient, which indicates that after fuel-reduction management starts, managers need to be persistent with repeated treatment, especially in the faster-growing forests in the southern United States.},

Variability, however, often depends on external factors that act as disturbances, making it difficult to compare its value across systems and relate it to other stability concepts. Here we show how variability, when viewed as a response to stochastic perturbations, can reveal inherent stability properties of ecological communities, with clear connections with other stability notions. This requires abandoning one-dimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of  variability values associated to a given community, reflecting the whole set of perturbations that can generate variability. Against the vertiginous dimensionality of the perturbation set, we show that a generic variability-abundance pattern emerges  from community assembly, which relates variability to the abundance of perturbed species. As a consequence, the response to stochastic immigration is governed by rare species while common species drive the response to environmental perturbations. In particular, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes can lead to opposite diversity-stability patterns, which can be understood from basic statistics of the abundance distribution. Our work shows that a multidimensional perspective on variability allows one to better appreciate the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.},

The UN projects a human population of approximately 11 billion by the end of the 21st century; requiring additional agricultural land, greater demands for natural resources, and technological advancements. We model human population over the next century, emphasizing feedbacks between natural and agricultural resource availability and human demography. We argue that an intensive agriculture approach to feeding the growing population is ill-conceived, without considering biodiversity and ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient cycling, pollination, water purification, pest control). The productivity of agricultural land and human population dynamics are dependent on the area of natural land—generally, tipping at 5 billion ha of natural land (approximately 40\% of the Earth’s terrestrial area). Furthermore, our model shows that an imprudent proactive approach (i.e., focusing on agriculture and ignoring ecosystem services) limits the success of reactive measures (i.e., restoration) in the future, while the inability to react to changes and recover natural systems leads to human population decline.},

The discrepancy between ﬁre occurrence and ﬁre risk by FFDWR (Forest Fire-Danger Weather Rating, a method issued by the National Meteorological Bureau, that is used to predict forest ﬁre probability through links between forest ﬁre occurrence and weather variables) in the northern part is more obvious than that in the southern part. Great discrepancy has emerged between ﬁre danger predicted by the method and actual ﬁre occurrence in recent years since a strict ﬁrebrand prohibition policy has signiﬁcantly reduced ﬁrebrands in the region. A probabilistic method predicting ﬁre probability by introducing an Ignition Component (IC) in the National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) adopted in the United States to depict effects of both ﬁrebrand and weather-fuel complex on ﬁre occurrence is developed to solve the problem. The suitability and accuracy of the new method in the region were assessed. Results show that the method is suitable in the region. IC or the modiﬁed IC can be adopted to depict the effect of the weather-fuel complex on ﬁre occurrence and to rate ﬁre danger for periods with fewer ﬁrebrands. Fire risk classes and corresponding preparedness level can be determined from IC in the region. Methods of the same principle could be established to diminish similar discrepancy between actual ﬁre occurrence and ﬁre danger in other countries.},

	abstract = {The ability of the human population to continue growing depends strongly on the ecosystem services provided by nature. Nature, however, is becoming more and more degraded as the number of individuals increases, which could potentially threaten the future well-being of the human population. We use a dynamic model to conceptualise links between the global proportion of natural habitats and human demography, through four categories of ecosystem services (provisioning, regulating, cultural recreational and informational) to investigate the common future of nature and humanity in terms of size and well-being. Our model shows that there is generally a trade-off between the quality of life and human population size and identiﬁes four short-term scenarios, corresponding to three long-term steady states of the model. First, human population could experience declines if nature becomes too degraded and regulating services diminish; second the majority of the population could be in a famine state, where the population continues to grow with minimal food provision. Between these scenarios, a desirable future scenario emerges from the model. It occurs if humans convert enough land to feed all the population, while maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. Finally, we ﬁnd a fourth scenario, which combines famine and a decline in the population because of an overexploitation of land leading to a decrease in food production. Human demography is embedded in natural dynamics; the two factors should be considered together if we are to identify a desirable future for both nature and humans.},

The predator is partially dependent on the prey followed by Holling type-II functional response. Due to habitat complexity and prey refuge, the Holling type-II functional response is modiﬁed in this work. We discuss the boundedness, permanence, local and global asymptotic behavior of the non-delayed and delayed models. The existence of periodic solutions via Hopf-bifurcation with respect to both the delays is established. The stability and direction of Hopf-bifurcation is also analyzed by using Normal form theory and Centre manifold theory. Lastly, numerical simulations have been carried out to conﬁrm the analytical ﬁndings. The main objective of this work is to balance the prey-predator relationship in the presence of habitat complexity, prey refuge and delays.},

Besides mathematical analysis and extracting new results on the equilibrium points and local stability studies of discrete-time commensurate fractional-order singular (FOS) state space systems, some basic dynamical properties and qualitative analysis of the new chaotic FOS logistic map are studied, either numerically or analytically, to explore the impacts of real order and economic interest on the presented system in biological contexts.},

The concepts of forward time−τ map and characteristic function are exploited to display the Bernoulli-shift features and modes. Particularly, it is rigorously veriﬁed that ECAMs rule 10 actually deﬁnes a Bernoullimeasure global attractor in the bi-inﬁnite symbolic vector space. It is furthermore identiﬁed that ECAMs rule 10 possesses complicated symbolic dynamics; namely, it is endowed with temporal chaotic features as positive topological entropy and topologically mixing. Therefore, ECAMs rule 10 is chaotic on its global attractor according to deﬁnitions of both Li-York and Devaney. To this end, it should be underlined that the procedure proposed in this study is applied to other ECAMs rules with the same shifting mode, and the corresponding results are exhibited.},

The major purpose of this research is put forward to the consideration of inequality techniques together with a suitable LKFs, and mixed with the Leibniz–Newton formula within the structure of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It is amazing that, the leakage delay has a disrupting impact on the stability behaviour of such system and they cannot be neglected. Finally, numerical examples have been demonstrated to showing feasibility and applicability of the developed technique. In addition, the developed stability criteria tested for feasibility of the benchmark problem to explore the real-world application in the sense of discrete time-delay and leakage delay as a process variable in the system model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Szolnoki and Perc (2015) [44] found conformity-enhanced network reciprocity by introducing conformity-driven strategy-updating rule to an appropriate fraction of players. In this work, we treat strategy-updating rule as an attribute of players and allow for the evolution of the attribute, for example, the alternation of the strategy-updating rule between payoff-driven and conformity-driven rules with time. We introduce the persistence parameter T by assuming that players change their strategy-updating rules every T Monte Carlo time unit according to either unbiased rule or aspiration rule. We ﬁnd that frequent alternation of strategy-updating rule improves the conformity-enhanced network reciprocity for the unbiased rule, which leads that small T greatly promotes cooperation. On the other hand, we ﬁnd no improvement of conformity-enhanced network reciprocity for the aspiration rule.},

It is known to all that results vary with different reward methods. The tax mechanism, an effective tool to adjust the economy, inspires a reward approach where each player should pay corresponding taxes according to their payoff ranks to gather public funds, which is utilized to reward cooperators. There are three main reward levels: high intensity, middle intensity and low intensity. When total public funds keep relatively stable, the reward coverage is determined by the reward intensity. In other words, high intensity of reward is accompanied with narrow range and low intensity accompanies with wide range. Through the proposed model, whether the new reward mechanism can stimulate cooperation and what reward level is the optimum choice could be studied. Simulations reveal that this new mechanism is of great beneﬁt to cooperation and it is noteworthy that low reward intensity with wide coverage has the biggest impact on cooperation.},

In the present paper, we propose a modified strategy updating model, in which strategy preference has a significant influence on the strategy adoption. Strategy preference adjusts the probability of imitation according to partner’s strategy in the spatial prisoner’s dilemma game. This characteristic depicts the subjectively cognitive ability of players in decision making. To explore the effect of the newly introduced mechanism, we also control the proportion of players using this new model. Numerical results chiefly focus on the evolution and proportion of cooperation, which are obtained under different proportions of this mechanism and intensities of strategy preference. For this dynamics, the results show that the fraction of cooperators presents a growth trend within a wide range of parameters. To validate the generality of this mechanism, we also employ the snowdrift game. Moreover, the evolution of cooperation on Erdős–Rényi random graphs is studied for the prisoner’s dilemma game. Interestingly, our analysis also reveals that the one’s strategy preference can influence the strategy selection of others. The results are conducive to understanding the emergence and persistence of cooperation during the strategy adoption in reality.},

	abstract = {We studied the effect of three strategy updating rules in coevolving prisoner’s dilemma games where agents (nodes) can switch both the strategy and social partners. Under two node-based strategy updating rules, strategy updating occurs between a randomly chosen focal node and its randomly selected neighbour. The focal agent becomes the strategy recipient and may imitate the strategy of the neighbour according to the payoff difference, i.e. voter-model-like dynamics (VMLD), or becomes a strategy donor and thus may be imitated by the neighbour, i.e. invasion-process-like dynamics (IPLD). For edgebased updating rules, one edge is selected, and the roles of the two connected nodes (donor or recipient) are randomly decided, i.e. edge-based dynamics (EBD). A computer simulation shows that partner switching supports the evolution of cooperation under VMLD, which has been utilised in many studies on spatial evolutionary games, whereas cooperators often vanish under IPLD. The EBD results lie between these two processes. This difference is prominent among nodes with large degrees. In addition, partner switching induces a non-monotonic relationship between the fraction of cooperators and intensity of selection under VMLD and EBD, and a weak or strong selection supports cooperation. In contrast, only a strong selection supports cooperators under IPLD. Similar differences in the enhancement of cooperation are observed when games are played on static heterogeneous networks. Our results imply that the direction of imitation is quite important for understanding the evolutionary process of cooperation.},

Evolutionary results show that cooperators dominate the situation and nearly reach a state of global cooperation with the advent of lottery tickets. The greater the winning rate ( w) or the higher lottery bonus (R), the easier the cooperation will be. Besides, the combination of a moderate value of w and a small value of R can help the organizer who is responsible for the provision of public goods, to achieve the optimal result in stimulating collective donations.

The relationships between these cell populations are derived from the law of mass action, assuming that a conjugate is formed in the interaction between immune and tumour cells. A nonlinearity in the production of immune cells, based on previous analyses, is introduced and explained. Using previously chosen model parameters, the maximal Lyapunov exponent is calculated numerically as 0.0218, demonstrating the existence of chaotic behaviour. Under the variation of one particular nonlinear rate constant, four distinct types of attractor are observed. Of biological importance, chaotic behaviour is shown to lead to a significantly higher maximum tumour size when compared to nonchaotic behaviour. Counterintuitively, increasing the parameter associated with the killing of tumour cells by immune cells is demonstrated to increase the maximum tumour size when this parameter is below the threshold at which the equilibrium is zero tumour cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In absence of exploitation, it is observed that alternative source of food to the predator has a negative effect on the growth of the prey species. Moreover, in the presence of alternative food maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level of prey exploitation may not prevent the extinction of the predator species. Hence, to protect the predator species from extinction a control instrument, tax is imposed on the landed ﬁsh and the ﬁshing effort is taken as dynamic variable. Optimal tax policy is obtained using Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Some numerical simulations are given to verify some of our analytical results and optimal and suboptimal paths are obtained.},

I propose that the biggest obstacle to this forward step is that biological researchers are not yet familiar with the properties of tensor variables, as compared with scalars. This key difference is that tensor properties can and usually do have different amounts in different directions, whereas scalar properties cannot vary with direction. Examples of tensor variables include stress, strain, curvature, permeability, and stiffness. Examples of scalar properties include chemical concentrations, osmotic pressure, hydrostatic pressure, adhesiveness and electrical voltage. Even D'Arcy Thompson treated mechanical tension (which is the classic example of a tensor variable) as if it were a scalar constant. This greatly reduced the number of geometric shapes that he could explain as being directly produced by forces. For example, in order to generate cylinders, surface contractions need to be twice as strong in one direction as compared with the perpendicular direction. Unless surface contractions vary with direction, only spheres can be generated.},

	abstract = {Evolution of living systems is a succession of historical changes in their equilibrium states. In the individual life cycle, every such state is realized as an equilibrium of developmental system, i.e. as its adult organizational norm. A trigger for a switching the system to a search for a new equilibrium is the loss under critical conditions of effective regulation of normal development towards uniform final state. This is manifested by replacement of the adult norm by its individual deviations. Thus, the organizational change begins with its adult state, which is the first to undergo the disturbance under new conditions. Accordingly, with the transition of the organization to a new equilibrium, the remodeling of the developmental system extends in generations from the adult stage to earlier ones. These premises contrast with the accepted belief that evolutionary events begin with individual changes in the germ cell. The only substantiated alternative to the last approach is objectively presented by the concepts of Schmalhausen and Waddington, in which the change in systemic organization starts with stabilization of selected phenotypic variations generated by violation of the current adult norm. The evolutionary spreading of organizational changes towards the early developmental stages constitutes in this case a natural consequence of the stabilization process. This course of events is actually reflected in different ways in the many empirical generalizations that have grown in the scope of more traditional views. It may be predicted that this pattern will come to provide a basis for a revised understanding of the evolutionary process.},

The homeostatic stable non-equilibrium is realized internally by selecting the trajectories maintaining stable configurations from those disturbing it and supported by the dynamical structure of metabolism consisting of metabolic cycles, feedback loops and feedforward constraints. In the developing systems, according to Bauer, the principle of stable non-equilibrium is transformed into the principle of increasing external work which is grounded in the hyper-restorative non-equilibrium. The basis of this principle, as formulated by Lev Beloussov, is a hyper-restorative process during conformational relaxation of biomacromolecules which adds extra energy in the system and governs its complexification in which a new optimal coordinate pattern is searched. At the quantum level, this complexification is determined by the parametric refinement process in the field of possibilities. The complexification process takes place at the level of the cytoskeleton which represents a macroscopic enzymatic system and can generate differentiation waves that spread between cells. This may be associated with the function of cytoskeleton of transmitting signals and generating impulses. Different types of waves during morphogenesis correspond to different ranges of wavelengths of emission, from biophoton radiation to the hypersound waves in transmission of neural impulses. It is concluded that biological morphogenesis is based on the hyper-restorative non-equilibrium supported by the functional structure of the cytoskeleton.},

	abstract = {How complex traits arise within organisms over evolutionary time is an important question that has relevance both to the understanding of biological systems and to the design of bio-inspired computing systems. This paper investigates the process of acquiring complex traits within epiNet, a recurrent connectionist architecture capable of adapting its topology during execution. Inspired by the biological processes of gene regulation and epigenetics, epiNet captures biological organisms’ ability to alter their regulatory topologies according to environmental stimulus. By applying epiNet to a series of computational tasks, each requiring a range of complex behaviours to solve, and capturing the evolutionary process in detail, we can show not only how the physical structure of epiNet changed when acquiring complex traits, but also how these changes in physical structure aﬀected its dynamic behaviour. This is facilitated by using a lightweight optimisation method which makes minor iterative changes to the network structure so that when complex traits emerge for the ﬁrst time, a direct lineage can be observed detailing exactly how they evolved. From this we can build an understanding of how complex traits evolve and which regulatory environments best allow for the emergence of these complex traits, pointing us towards computational models that allow more swift and robust acquisition of complex traits when optimised in an evolutionary computing setting.},

During embryogenesis and in vivo stem cell differentiation, cells/tissues deploy epigenetic mechanisms to accomplish differentiation and give rise to the fully developed organism. Although a biochemistry description of cellular genetics and epigenetics is important, additional mechanisms are necessary to completely solve the problem of embryogenesis, especially differentiation and the spatiotemporal coordination of cells/tissues during morphogenesis. The cell state splitter and differentiation wave working-model was initially proposed to explain the homeostatic primary neural induction in amphibian embryos. Here the model is adopted to explain experimental ﬁndings on in vitro embryonic stem cell, pluripotency and differentiation. Moreover, since somatic cells can be reverted to a stem-cell-like pluripotent state through the laboratory procedure called epigenetic reprogramming, erection of a cell state splitter could be a key event in their successful reprogramming. Overall, the cell state splitter working-model introduces a bistable cytoskeletal mechanism that partially explains cell fate determination and biological development. It offers an interdisciplinary framework that bridges the gap between molecular epigenetics and embryogenesis.},

A number of elementary morphogenetic events demonstrating that these feedbacks are directed towards hyper-restoration (restoration with an overshoot) of the initial state of mechanical stresses are described. Moreover, we show that these reactions are bound together into the larger scale feedbacks. That permits to suggest a reconstruction of morphogenetic successions in early Metazoan development concentrated around two main archetypes distinguished by the blastopores geometry. The perspectives of applying the same approach to cell differentiation are outlined. By discussing the problem of positional information we suggest that the developmental pathway of a given embryo part depends upon its preceded deformations and the corresponding mechanical stresses rather than upon its static position at any moment of development.},

Previous experiments indicated that under more realistic conditions of ﬁnite populations and stochastic payoffs, populations may evolve in trajectories that are unrelated to an ESS, even in very simple games. The simulations offered here extend earlier research by employing truncation selection with random parental selection in a hawk–dove game. Payoffs are determined in pairwise contests using either the expected outcome, or the result of a random variable.

Previously, we considered the scenario where an encounter between a cooperator and a defector results in the defector’s identity being revealed with some probability, while an encounter between two defectors does not reveal their identities. Here, we study a generalization of this model: an encounter between a cooperator and a defector results in the defector’s identity being revealed with probability QC; an encounter between two defectors results in each of those defectors’ identities being revealed independently with probability QD. We find that larger values of QD can significantly increase both the average payoffs for cooperators and, in a dynamical setting, the basin of attraction for cooperation. Moreover, if QC is sufficiently small and QD is sufficiently large, then we find a new behavior over the previous model in which cooperators and defectors can stably coexist. We also study hesitation to cooperate with unknown individuals and defectors refusing interactions with known defectors to preserve their own unknown status.},

In this paper, we ﬁrst analyze a tri-trophic food chain, which is an extension of the Rosenzweig-MacArthur di-trophic food chain. We then explore the impact of harvesting individual trophic levels to answer the following questions : a) when a non-equilibrium dynamics persists, b) whether it can locally be stabilized to a steady state, c) when the system switches from a stable steady state to a non-equilibrium dynamics and d) whether the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) always exists when the top predator is harvested. It is shown that searching for a general theory to unify the harvesting induced stability must take into account the number of trophic levels and the degree of species enrichment, the outcomes that cannot be obtained from the earlier reports on prey-predator models. We also identify the situation where harvesting induces instability switching: the non-equilibrium state enters into a stable steady-state and then, upon more intensive harvesting, the steady-state again loses its stability. One of the new and important results is also that the MSY may not exist for harvesting the top predator. In general, our results contribute to biological conservation theory, ﬁshery and ecosystem biodiversity management.},

In recent years, the pro-tumor role of immunity factors such as regulatory T cells and TGF-β cytokines has specially been considered in mathematical modeling of tumor-immune interactions. This paper presents a novel structural methodology for reviewing these models and classiﬁes them into ﬁve subgroups on the basis of immune factors included. By using our experimental data due to immunotherapy experimentation in mice, these ﬁve modeling groups are evaluated and scored. The results show that a model with a small number of variables and coeﬃcients performs eﬃciently in predicting the tumor-immune system interactions. Though immunology theorems suggest to employ a larger number of variables and coeﬃcients, more complicated models are here shown to be ineﬃcient due to redundant parallel pathways. So, these models are trapped in local minima and restricted in prediction capability. This paper investigates the mathematical models that were previously developed and proposes variables and pathways that are essential for modeling tumor-immune. Using these variables and pathways, a minimal structure for modeling tumor-immune interactions is proposed for future studies.},

	abstract = {Coronary arteries are responsible for maintaining blood supply to the heart. When these arteries get blocked due to plaque deposition, the corresponding pathological condition is referred to as coronary artery disease. This disease develops gradually over the years and consequently, the function of the heart deteriorates, leading to a heart attack in many cases. As the symptoms manifest themselves only when it has become severe, detection of the disease often gets delayed. In order to detect it early and take preventive action, this work is aimed at detecting the arterial blockage in its early stage via cardiovascular modeling. To achieve this, the cardiovascular circulation has been modeled as a sixth order nonlinear system. Blood circulation in a body is viewed as an electrical system using the pressure-voltage analogy. In this case, the heart is considered as a self-excited generator. The rest of the body tissues form a systemic load. In the models reported in the literature, coronary circulation has been assumed to be a part of the systemic load. However, this circulation path has its own importance as it is responsible for the blood supply to the heart. Therefore, in our work, the coronary path is separated out from the rest of the body tissues. This enables us to explicitly model the coronary arterial resistance and thereby helps us to detect coronary arterial blockage condition by estimating this parameter from blood pressure measurements. Increase in the coronary resistance is found to reduce the left ventricular ejection fraction; this information can therefore be used as an index for coronary arterial blockage. It has been shown that the systolic function of the heart deteriorates when the resistance of the coronary path increases beyond a critical value; the situation can be related to a severe blockage condition. The model has been tested on a chosen sample of 20 subjects suﬀering from coronary artery disease and the results are found to be quite promising.},

To examine the impact of initial population on exploitation, we analyze a single species model with strong Allee effect. It is found that even when the MSY exists, the dynamic solution may not converge to the equilibrium stock if the initial population level is higher but near the critical threshold level. In a prey–predator system with Allee effect in the prey species, the initial population does not have such important impact neither on MSY nor on maximum sustainable total yield (MSTY). However, harvesting the top predator may cause extinction of all species if odd number of trophic levels exist in the ecosystem. With regard to the second problem, we study two prey–predator models and establish that increasing harvesting effort either on prey, predator or both prey and predator destroys previously existing oscillation. Moreover, equilibrium stock both at MSY and MSTY level is stable. We also discuss the validity of found results to other prey–predator systems.},

The strength of the synapses may vary over time, a phenomenon known as synaptic plasticity. This is the process by which it is believed memory and learning is governed. Recent studies revealed environmental factors affect the strength of synapses, and the way neurons communicate to each other. This poses the question as to what extent the pre- and post- synaptic neurons sense the environmental changes, and in turn adjust their synaptic link. Here, we model the behavior of an interconnected neuronal network in various environmental conditions as a multi-agent system in a game theoretic framework. We focus on a CA1 lattice subﬁeld as an example plastic neuronal network. Our analysis revealed the neuronal network converges to different equilibria depending on the environmental changes.

This heterogeneity results in asymmetric interactions where the characteristics of the interaction may depend on an individual’s location. Interestingly, in non-varying heterogeneous environments, the long-term dynamics are the same as for symmetric interactions in an average, homogeneous environment. However, introducing environmental feedback between an individual’s strategy and the quality of its patch results in rich eco-evolutionary dynamics. Thus, individuals act as ecosystem engineers. The nature of the feedback and the rate of ecological changes can relax or aggravate social dilemmas and promote persistent periodic oscillations of strategy abundance and environmental quality.},

	abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that mainly affects the joints. It is characterized by synovial inﬂammation, which may result in cartilage and bone destruction. The present paper develops a mathematical model of chronic RA. The model is represented by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) in the synovial ﬂuid, the synovial membrane, and the cartilage. The model characterizes the progression of the disease in terms of the degradation of the cartilage. More precisely, we assume a simpliﬁed geometry in which the synovial membrane and the cartilage are planar layers adjacent to each other. We then quantify the state of the disease by how much the cartilage layer has decreased, or, equivalently, how much the synovial layer has increased. The model is used to evaluate treatments of RA by currently used drugs, as well as by experimental drugs.},

Therefore, the evolution of egalitarian behaviour has been the subject of long-standing debate in a wide variety of disciplines. A recent hypothesis states that a social control against potentially dominant individuals played an important role in the emergence of an egalitarian society. In the present study, we modelled this hypothesis based on the n-player game framework, in which the owner, who may attempt to monopolise resources, could be punished by a coalition of other group members. Our results suggest that a potentially despotic payoff structure can promote the evolution of egalitarian behaviour. Besides, large group size, small cost of competition, and variation in the strengths of individuals can promote the evolution of egalitarian behaviour. Our results suggest the importance of both social control against dominant individuals and beneﬁts of a coalition for the evolution of egalitarian behaviour.},

	abstract = {Cooperative interactions constitute the backbone of many biological and social systems. Since cooperation is prone to exploitation, these systems must incorporate mechanisms that prevent the spreading of defective behaviors. One such mechanism is modularity, i.e., the tendency of a social network to be organized in modules, where individuals within a module tend to interact strongly among themselves while avoiding interacting with individuals from other modules. This structure allows cooperation to prevail by having modules of cooperative individuals with a limited exposure to defectors. To address the rate and shape of the effect of modularity on the resilience of cooperation, here we study a variant of the Prisoner’s Dilemma on modular networks. Our simulations reveal a sharp transition between a resilient and a vulnerable regime as modularity exceeds a critical threshold. By using a simpliﬁed mathematical model, we show that the observed threshold is equivalent to the epidemic threshold found in a certain class of SIR models. This allows us to derive an explicit condition under which a cooperative society is expected to be resilient to invasive defectors.},

We addressed these issues using a stage-structured individual-based model that incorporates life-history parameters common to many holometabolous insects. The model was calibrated using time series data from a 49-generation experiment on laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster, subjected to four different combinations of larval and adult nutritional levels. The model was able to capture multiple qualitative and quantitative aspects of the empirical time series across three independent studies. We then simulated the model to explore the interaction of various life-history parameters and nutritional levels in determining population stability. In all nutritional regimes, constancy stability of the populations was reduced upon increasing egg-hatchability, critical mass, and proportion of body resource allocated to female fecundity. However, the effects of increasing sensitivity of female-fecundity to adult density on constancy stability varied across nutrition regimes. The effects of unequal sex-ratio and sex-speciﬁc culling were greatly inﬂuenced by fecundity but not by levels of juvenile nutrition. Finally, we investigated the implications of some of these insights on the eﬃciency of the widely-used pest control method, the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). We show that increasing the amount of juvenile food had no effects on SIT eﬃciency when the density-independent fecundity is low, but reduces SIT eﬃciency when the density-independent fecundity is high.},

	abstract = {Adenocarcinoma is the most frequent cancer affecting the prostate walnut-size gland in the male reproductive system. Such cancer may have a very slow progression or may be associated with a “dark prognosis” when tumor cells are spreading very quickly. Prostate cancers have the particular properties to be marked by the level of prostate speciﬁc antigen (PSA) in blood which allows to follow its evolution. At least in its ﬁrst phase, prostate adenocarcinoma is most often hormone-dependent and, consequently, hormone therapy is a possible treatment. Since few years, hormone therapy started to be provided intermittently for improving patient’s quality of life. Today, durations of on- and off-treatment periods are still chosen empirically, most likely explaining why there is no clear beneﬁt from the survival point of view. We therefore developed a model for describing the interaction between the tumor environment, the PSA produced by hormone-dependent and hormone-independent tumor cells, respectively, and the level of androgens. Model parameters were identiﬁed using a genetic algorithm applied to the PSA time series measured in a few patients who initially received prostatectomy and were then treated by intermittent hormone therapy (LHRH analogs and anti-androgen). The measured PSA time series is quite correctly reproduced by free runs over the whole follow-up. Model parameter values allow for distinguishing different types of patient (age and Gleason score) meaning that the model can be individualized. We thus showed that the long-term evolution of the cancer can be affected by durations of on- and off-treatment periods.},

Mathematical models like the Klausmeier model—a set of coupled partial differential equations describing vegetation and water densities in space and time—are central to understanding their formation and development. One assumption made for mathematical simplicity is the local dispersal of seeds via a diffusion term. In fact, a large amount of work focuses on ﬁtting dispersal ‘kernels’, probability density functions for seed dispersal distance, to empirical data of different species and modes of dispersal. In this paper, we address this discrepancy by analysing an extended Klausmeier model that includes long-distance seed dispersal via a non-local convolution term in place of diffusion, and assessing its effect on the resilience of striped patterns. Many authors report a slow uphill migration of stripes; but others report no detectable migration speed. We show that long-distance seed dispersal permits the formation of patterns with a very slow (possibly undetectable) migration speed, and even stationary patterns which could explain the inconsistencies in the empirical data. In general, we show that the resilience of patterns to reduced rainfall may vary signiﬁcantly depending on the rate of seed dispersal and the width of the dispersal kernel, and compare a selection of ecologically relevant kernels to examine the variation in pattern resilience.},

This is carried out on two exemplar cases: a torus and a sphere. We compute bifurcation boundaries for the homogeneous steady state when the homogeneous system is monostable. We exhibit Turing and Turing–Hopf bifurcations, as well as additional patterning outside of these bifurcation regimes due to the multistability of patterned states. We consider static and growing domains, where the growth is slow, isotropic, and exponential in time, allowing for a simple analytical calculation of these bifurcations in terms of model parameters. Numerical simulations allow us to discuss the role played by the growth and the curvature of the domains on the pattern selection on the torus and the sphere. We demonstrate parameter regimes where the linear theory can successfully predict the kind of pattern (homogeneous and heterogeneous oscillations and stationary spatial patterns) but not their detailed nonlinear structure. We also ﬁnd parameter regimes where the linear theory fails, such as Hopf regimes which give rise to spatial patterning (depending on geometric details), where we suspect that multistability plays a key role in the departure from homogeneity. Finally we also demonstrate effects due to the evolution of nonuniform patterns under growth, suggesting important roles for growth in reaction-diffusion systems beyond modifying instability regimes.},

The majority of patients initially respond well to abiraterone but the cancer cells evolve resistance and the cancer progresses within a median time of 16 months. Incorporating techniques that attempt to delay or prevent the growth of the resistant cancer cell phenotype responsible for disease progression have only recently entered the clinical setting. Here we use evolutionary game theory to model the evolutionary dynamics of patients with mCRPC subject to abiraterone therapy. In evaluating therapy options, we adopt an optimal control theory approach and seek the best treatment schedule using nonlinear constrained optimization. We compare patient outcomes from standard clinical treatments to those with other treatment objectives, such as maintaining a constant total tumor volume or minimizing the fraction of resistant cancer cells within the tumor. Our model predicts that continuous high doses of abiraterone as well as other therapies aimed at curing the patient result in accelerated competitive release of the resistant phenotype and rapid subsequent tumor progression. We ﬁnd that long term control is achievable using optimized therapy through the restrained and judicious application of abiraterone, maintaining its effectiveness while providing acceptable patient quality of life. Implementing this strategy will require overcoming psychological and emotional barriers in patients and physicians as well as acquisition of a new class of clinical data designed to accurately estimate intratumoral eco-evolutionary dynamics during therapy.},

Using EcoSim, a predator-prey individual-based model, we compare individuals with stable food resources with those in environments where there are ﬂuctuating food resources in terms of adaptation through behavioral plasticity and evolution. The purpose of our study is to determine whether evolution and behavioral plasticity truly play a role in adapting to an environment with ﬂuctuating food resources, as well as to determine whether there are speciﬁc gene divergences between gene pools in ﬂuctuating food resource environments versus gene pools where food resources are relatively stable. An important result of our study is that individuals in environments that are unstable with respect to food resource availability exhibited signiﬁcant differences in behaviors versus those in environments with stable food resources. Although behavioral plasticity facilitates a rapid response to unstable food conditions, our study revealed the evolution of perceptual traits such as vision range in reaction to ﬂuctuating food resources, indicating the importance of evolution in adapting to unstable resource environments in the long run. Moreover, using decision trees, we found that there were signiﬁcant behavioral gene divergences between individuals in environments with ﬂuctuating food resources as opposed to individuals in environments with stable food resources.},

This undermines our ability to understand the feedbacks between human behavior and ecosystem change. Focusing on the problem of species dispersal, we evaluate the effect of dispersal on biodiversity in a system subject to predation by humans. People are assumed to obtain beneﬁts from (a) the direct consumption of species (provisioning services), (b) the nonconsumptive use of species (cultural services), and (c) the buffering effects of the mix of species (regulating services). We ﬁnd that the effects of dispersal on biodiversity depend jointly on the competitive interactions among species, and on human preferences over species and the services they provide. We ﬁnd that while biodiversity may be greatest at intermediate levels of dispersal, this depends on structure of preferences across the metacommunity.},

It is also found that the internal competition between biomass has an effect on the characters of banded vegetation. In particular, it is shown that the internal competition reaction leads to the decrease of the migration speed and the increase of the wavelength of the stripe patterns.},

In general it is observed that exploitation at MSY (of single species) or MSTY (of multispecies) level may cause the extinction of several species. In particular, for traditional prey–predator system, ﬁshing under combined harvesting effort at MSTY (if it exists) level may be a sustainable policy, but if MSTY does not exist then it is due to the extinction of the predator species only. In generalist prey–predator system, harvesting of any one of the species at MSY level is always a sustainable policy, but harvesting of both the species at MSTY level may or may not be a sustainable policy. In addition, we have also investigated the MSY and MSTY policy in a traditional tri-trophic and four trophic food chain models.},

In this paper, we aim to extend this result to a more general situation, where the environmental heterogeneity is taken into account and the boundary condition at the downstream end becomes very ﬂexible including the standard Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin type conditions as special cases. Our main approaches are to exclude the existence of co-existence (positive) steady state and to provide a clear picture on the stability of semi-trivial steady states, where we introduced new ideas and techniques to overcome the emerging difﬁculties. Based on these two aspects and the theory of abstract competitive systems, we achieve a complete understanding on the global dynamics.},

In simulated disease models, we demonstrated that PBMDR outperforms existing global optimization algorithms in terms of its ability to explore and power to detect speciﬁc SNP–genotype combinations.

	abstract = {A mathematical model of the interactions between a growing tumor and the immune system is presented. The equations and parameters of the model are based on experimental and clinical results from published studies. The model includes the primary cell populations involved in effector T-cell mediated tumor killing: regulatory T cells, helper T cells, and dendritic cells. A key feature is the inclusion of multiple mechanisms of immunosuppression through the main cytokines and growth factors mediating the interactions between the cell populations. Decreased access of effector cells to the tumor interior with increasing tumor size is accounted for. The model is applied to tumors with different growth rates and antigenicities to gauge the relative importance of various immunosuppressive mechanisms. The most important factors leading to tumor escape are TGF-b-induced immunosuppression, conversion of helper T cells into regulatory T cells, and the limitation of immune cell access to the full tumor at large tumor sizes. The results suggest that for a given tumor growth rate, there is an optimal antigenicity maximizing the response of the immune system. Further increases in antigenicity result in increased immunosuppression, and therefore a decrease in tumor killing rate. This result may have implications for immunotherapies which modulate the effective antigenicity. Simulation of dendritic cell therapy with the model suggests that for some tumors, there is an optimal dose of transfused dendritic cells.},

	abstract = {The theoretical biologist Robert Rosen developed a highly original approach for investigating the question “What is life?”, the most fundamental problem of biology. Considering that Rosen made extensive use of mathematics it might seem surprising that his ideas have only rarely been implemented in mathematical models. On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect underlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships between the elements of a biological system, according to the motto “throw away the physics, keep the organisation”. Rosen's strong rejection of mechanistic models that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might have deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own work. On the other hand Rosen's presentation of his modelling framework, (M, R) systems, is highly abstract which makes it hard to appreciate how this approach could be applied to concrete biological problems. In this article, both the mathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen's work are analysed that relate to his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen's relational models are a particular type of mechanistic model with speciﬁc underlying assumptions rather than a fundamentally different approach that excludes mechanistic models. The strengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison with current network biology literature. Finally, it is argued that Rosen's deﬁnition of life, “organisms are closed to efﬁcient causation”, should be considered as a hypothesis to be tested and ideas how this postulate could be implemented in mathematical models are presented.},

Both complexity and chaos show the unavoidability of uncertainty - whether it is embedded in feedback cycles and emergence or in the inﬁnite precision of initial conditions. A subtler transformation is ongoing, however: a transformation at a deeper level than the move from linear to non-linear models and much less visible than it. Both linear and non-linear techniques are forms of predicative modeling. The underlying unproven assumption is that the vast majority of systems are predicative, and only marginal, borderline systems are impredicative. Yet the transformation to which I am alluding directs attention to the opposite possibility: the unquestioned belief in the predicativity of most systems may prove to be illusory. As a matter of fact, many disciplines, including sociology, anthropology, and biology, exhibit varieties of self-reference, which is the primary source of impredicativity. The idea that most systems are indeed impredicative opens new avenues for science. Moreover, it may help in addressing some of the most egregious failures of contemporary science. The possibilities to deepen and extend science as well as to address daunting obstacles of present science are serious enough reasons for thorough investigation of the difference between predicative and impredicative science.},

The theoretical biologist Robert Rosen argued that living organisms are complex in this sense, and his (M, R) systems provide a description of a living organism in which the central point is that organisms are closed to efﬁcient causation, which means that all the speciﬁc catalysts needed for the organism to maintain itself must be produced by the organism itself. This includes the catalysts needed to maintain the other catalysts. On the other hand an organism is not closed to material causation, because there must be a net overall irreversible process to provide the necessary thermodynamic driving force for metabolism. (M, R) systems are usually discussed in relation to individual organisms, but they can also be applied to interactions between different organisms, allowing analysis, for example, of how two or more species can exist in symbiotic relationships with one another, able to live together, but not separately. Application of Rosennean complexity to ﬁelds other than life is possible, as we discuss. Rosen’s holistic vision of organisms, in which all components affect all others, has implications for the concepts of hierarchy and downward causation that are sometimes invoked in philosophical discussions, because it means that there is no hierarchy and no downward causation.},

The implications identiﬁed in this paper of such a constructionist perspective could challenge not only ecologists, but also theorists in all ﬁelds that make use of models without a process of construction over time of the complexity of the situation studied. This paper centers not so much on advancing this perspective, but on two consequent puzzles: Why does the constructionist view seem difﬁcult for theorists to take up? What social implications should be drawn from the resulting view of complexity, especially to the extent that critical events cannot be predicted?

Next, we analysed a global dataset of 44 experiments that crossed biodiversity with environmental conditions. Conﬁrming our main model prediction, the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning tends to be greater at intermediate levels of environmental stress, but varies among studies corresponding to differences in stress-effects on species interactions. Together, these results suggest that increases in stress from ongoing global environmental changes may amplify the consequences of biodiversity changes.},

	abstract = {Synchronization is a natural phenomenon in non-linear dynamical systems. The relative importance of various mechanisms of population synchrony has been debated by population ecologists. The debate revolves around the issue whether the regionally extrinsic or locally intrinsic agents are more potent. In the present paper, we have attempted to demonstrate that a local intrinsic mechanism, predation, can be more common cause of population synchrony than is believed. Two chaotic food chains having diﬀerent kinds of top-predators are synchronized using a recently proposed algorithm by Lu and Cao [Lu J, Cao J. Adaptive complete synchronization of two identical or diﬀerent chaotic (hyperchaotic) dynamical systems with fully unknown parameters. Chaos 2005;15(043901):1–10]. The idiosyncracy of this approach is that it takes care of the uncertainties involved in the parameter estimation. The complete synchronization achieved is robust to noise present in the system. We suggest that local intrinsic causes of population synchrony should be given more attention.},

We show that the underlying topology may alter the early stage of the coarsening process, once large values of the tolerance are used, while for lower ones a different mechanism is at work and it results to be topology independent.},

	abstract = {While planet boundaries are being crossed and ecosystems degraded, the Ecosystem Service (ES) concept represents a potential decision-making tool for improved natural resources management. The main aim of this paper is to assess the impact of forest cover on water related ES in Wallonia (Belgium) in terms of quantity and timing. We developed an approach based on easily accessible data, monitored in several countries and using straightforward statistical methods. This led us to study ES at “real-life” catchments scale: 22 catchments – from 30 to 250 km2– with mixed land covers were studied. We approached the water supply and ﬂood protection services through 5 indicators extracted from 10 hydrological years (2005–2014) discharge data series. These were computed annually and seasonally (vegetation period from March to September and “non-vegetation” period the rest of the year). The water supply was assessed through the speciﬁc volume Vs, the baseﬂow index BFI and the speciﬁc discharge exceeded 95\% of the time Q95s whereas the ﬂood protection service was approached through the speciﬁc discharge exceeded 5\% of the time Q05s and the ﬂashiness index FI. Our study gives two main insights. First, statistical analyses show that forest cover negatively impact water supply when studying annual and “non-vegetation” period ﬂows in general (Vs) but positively when studying low ﬂows (Q95s). Regarding ﬂood protection a slightly negative impact of forest cover on high ﬂows (Q05s) was highlighted in the “non-vegetation” period. Results also show a negative impact of forests annually and in the vegetation period on the ﬂashy behaviour of the catchment thus a positive impact on the ﬂood protection ES. The “year” effect is overall highly signiﬁcant testifying the importance of climatic factors. Rainfall is often signiﬁcant and can be considered as a main driver of these ES. Secondly, analyzing the quality of the models produced and the results overall we assume that other variables characterizing the catchments such as topography or soil types do play a signiﬁcant role in the delivery of these ES. This questions the use of land cover proxies in assessing and mapping of hydrological ES at a complex landscape scale. We thus recommend further research to keep improving land cover proxies if they are used.},

	abstract = {There is now ample evidence that biodiversity stabilizes aggregated ecosystem functions such as primary production in changing environments. In primary producer systems, this stabilizing effect is found to be driven by higher functional resistance (i.e. reduced changes in functions by environmental changes) rather than through higher functional resilience (i.e. rapid recovery following environmental changes) in more diverse systems. The stability of aggregated ecosystem functions directly depends on changes in species composition and by consequence their functional contributions to ecosystem functions. Still, it remains only theoretically explored how biodiversity can stabilise ecosystem functions by affecting compositional stability. Here, we demonstrate how biodiversity effects on compositional stability drive biodiversity effects on functional stability in diatom communities. In a microcosm experiment, we exposed 39 communities of five different levels of species richness (1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 species) to three concentrations of a chemical stressor (0, 25 and 250 μg L-1 atrazine) for four weeks, after which all communities were transferred to atrazine-free medium for three more weeks. Biodiversity simultaneously increased increasing functional and compositional resistance, but decreased functional and compositional resilience. These results confirm the theoretically proposed link between biodiversity effects on functional and compositional stability in primary producer systems, and provide a mechanistic underpinning for observed biodiversity-stability relationships. Finally, we discuss how higher compositional stability can be expected to become increasingly important in stabilising ecosystem functions under field conditions when multiple environmental stressors fluctuate simultaneously.},

This is performed by integrating the two-step decision making sub-models, Perception-of-Climate-Change and Adaptation-Choice-Strategies, to the Land Use Dynamic Simulator (LUDAS). The simulation results suggest that the land-use choices in the study area reﬂect a tendency towards increasing subsistence farming in an area where there has been a gradual trend away from traditional land uses such as cereal production to the cultivation of groundnut, rice, maize and soybean. Groundnut monoculture production has emerged locally as coping measure for dealing with increased climatic variability. In terms of livelihood strategy, there is an increasing contribution of rice and groundnut to household gross incomes. The predicted pattern of changes in gross household income under a scenario in which climate change is perceived by local farmers explicitly revealed the contribution of adaptation options to household livelihood strategy.},

Current methods use for instance correlation between Default Mode Network regions. However, these methods yields limited results. The method we develop in this master’s thesis exploits the dynamics of the underlying network given by fMRI data. This approach is based on the Koopman theory and the connection between the Koopman operator spectrum and the network spectrum. The main assumption of this method is that changes in patient’s consciousness level implies changes in the network and therefore in the measured spectrum.},

	abstract = {The information processing in the large scale network of the human brain is related to its cognitive functions. Due to requirements for adaptation to changing environments under biological constraints, these processes in the brain can be hypothesized to be optimized. The principles based on the information optimization are expected to play a central role in affecting the dynamics and topological structure of the brain network. Recent studies on the functional connectivity between brain regions, referred to as the functional connectome, reveal characteristics of their networks, such as self-organized criticality of brain dynamics and small-world topology. However, these important attributes are established separately, and their relations to the principle of the information optimization are unclear. Here, we show that the maximization principle of the mutual information entropy induces the optimal state, at which the small-world network topology and the criticality in the activation dynamics emerge. Our ﬁndings, based on the functional connectome analyses, show that according to the increasing mutual information entropy, the coactivation pattern converges to the state of self-organized criticality, and a phase transition of the network topology, which is responsible for the small-world topology, arises simultaneously at the same point. The coincidence of these phase transitions at the same critical point indicates that the criticality of the dynamics and the phase transition of the network topology are essentially rooted in the same phenomenon driven by the mutual information maximization. As a consequence, the two different attributes of the brain, self-organized criticality and small-world topology, can be understood within a uniﬁed perspective under the information-based principle. Thus, our study provides an insight into the mechanism underlying the information processing in the brain.},

	abstract = {Innovative agricultural systems need to combine the production of goods with the provision of environmental services. When agronomists analyse or design multifunctional agro-ecosystems, they thus need to include knowledge of an increasing range of scientiﬁc disciplines (plant biology, soil science, ecology, etc.) while continuing to use their systemic approach as a cornerstone. Increasing amounts of knowledge of different types (concepts and data) will thus have to be included in systemic approaches that are developed in the agronomic domain. Knowledge integration and sharing are frequently hampered by the lack of detail in the assumptions made in each discipline. We hypothesise that a standardised description of the conceptual model underlying data collection and the analysis of agro ecosystems would improve transparency and knowledge integration.},

	abstract = {Since the launch of the ﬁrst satellite in space, the number of space debris has been increasing every year. These fragments are concentrated at certain distances from the Earth by occupying speciﬁc orbits such as the geostationary orbit. The study of resonances is coupled with different surrounding disturbances to describe the dynamics of these debris. By modifying a conservative model, it is possible to introduce some dissipation effects that inﬂuence the variability of the system parameters, such like Poynting-Robertson effect and solar wind. In addition, the ﬁrst fundamental model of resonance is a reference to understand the potential transitions of trajectories between the circulation and libration zones due to the effects. This master’s thesis therefore aims to determine the probabilities of geostationary resonance capture of very light debris undergoing some decay effects of the semi-major axis.},

	abstract = {We use recent advances in the machine learning area known as 'reservoir computing' to formulate a method for model-free estimation from data of the Lyapunov exponents of a chaotic process. The technique uses a limited time series of measurements as input to a high-dimensional dynamical system called a 'reservoir'. After the reservoir's response to the data is recorded, linear regression is used to learn a large set of parameters, called the 'output weights'. The learned output weights are then used to form a modified autonomous reservoir designed to be capable of producing arbitrarily long time series whose ergodic properties approximate those of the input signal. When successful, we say that the autonomous reservoir reproduces the attractor's 'climate'. Since the reservoir equations and output weights are known, we can compute derivatives needed to determine the Lyapunov exponents of the autonomous reservoir, which we then use as estimates of the Lyapunov exponents for the original input generating system. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique with two examples, the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation. In particular, we use the Lorenz system to show that achieving climate reproduction may require tuning of the reservoir parameters. For the case of the KS equation, we note that as the system's spatial size is increased, the number of Lyapunov exponents increases, thus yielding a challenging test of our method, which we find the method successfully passes.},

	abstract = {Shannon information theory provides various measures of so-called "syntactic information", which reflect the amount of statistical correlation between systems. In contrast, the concept of "semantic information" refers to those correlations which carry significance or "meaning" for a given system. Semantic information plays an important role in many fields, including biology, cognitive science, and philosophy, and there has been a long-standing interest in formulating a broadly applicable and formal theory of semantic information. In this paper we introduce such a theory. We define semantic information as the syntactic information that a physical system has about its environment which is causally necessary for the system to maintain its own existence. "Causal necessity" is defined in terms of counter-factual interventions which scramble correlations between the system and its environment, while "maintaining existence" is defined in terms of the system's ability to keep itself in a low entropy state. We also use recent results in nonequilibrium statistical physics to analyze semantic information from a thermodynamic point of view. Our framework is grounded in the intrinsic dynamics of a system coupled to an environment, and is applicable to any physical system, living or otherwise. It leads to formal definitions of several concepts that have been intuitively understood to be related to semantic information, including "value of information", "semantic content", and "agency".},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional thermal lattice Boltzmann model (TLBM) using multirelaxation time method was used to simulate stratified atmospheric flows over a ridge. The main objective was to study the efficacy of this method for turbulent flows in the atmospheric boundary layer, complex terrain flows in particular. The simulation results were compared with results obtained using a traditional finite difference method based on the Navier–Stokes equations and with previous laboratory results on stably stratified flows over an isolated ridge. The initial density profile is neutral stratification in the boundary layer, topped with a stable cap and stable stratification aloft. The TLBM simulations produced waves, rotors, and hydraulic jumps in the lee side of the ridge for stably stratified flows, depending on the governing stability parameters. The Smagorinsky turbulence parameterization produced typical turbulence spectra for the velocity components at the lee side of the ridge, and the turbulent flow characteristics of varied stratifications were also analyzed. The comparison of TLBM simulations with other numerical simulations and laboratory studies indicated that TLBM is a viable method for numerical modeling of stratified atmospheric flows. To our knowledge, this is the first TLBM simulation of stratified atmospheric flow over a ridge. The details of the TLBM, its implementation of complex boundaries and the subgrid turbulence parameterizations used in this study are also described in this article.},

	abstract = {Mathematical biomedicine is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary field of research that connects the natural and exact sciences in an attempt to respond to the modeling and simulation challenges raised by biology and medicine. There exist a large number of mathematical methods and procedures that can be brought in to meet these challenges and this book presents a palette of such tools ranging from discrete cellular automata to cell population based models described by ordinary differential equations to nonlinear partial differential equations representing complex time- and space-dependent continuous processes. Both stochastic and deterministic methods are employed to analyze biological phenomena in various temporal and spatial settings. This book illustrates the breadth and depth of research opportunities that exist in the general field of mathematical biomedicine by highlighting some of the fascinating interactions that continue to develop between the mathematical and biomedical sciences. It consists of five parts that can be read independently, but are arranged to give the reader a broader picture of specific research topics and the mathematical tools that are being applied in its modeling and analysis. The main areas covered include immune system modeling, blood vessel dynamics, cancer modeling and treatment, and epidemiology. The chapters address topics that are at the forefront of current biomedical research such as cancer stem cells, immunodominance and viral epitopes, aggressive forms of brain cancer, or gene therapy. The presentations highlight how mathematical modeling can enhance biomedical understanding and will be of interest to both the mathematical and the biomedical communities including researchers already working in the field as well as those who might consider entering it. Much of the material is presented in a way that gives graduate students and young researchers a starting point for their own work.--},

	abstract = {When seeking to understand how computation is carried out in the cell to maintain itself in its environment, process signals and make decisions, the continuous nature of protein interaction processes forces us to consider also analog computation models and mixed analog-digital computation programs. However, recent results in the theory of analog computability and complexity establish fundamental links with classical programming. In this paper, we derive from these results the strong (uniform computability) Turing completeness of chemical reaction networks over a ﬁnite set of molecular species under the diﬀerential semantics, solving a long standing open problem. Furthermore we derive from the proof a compiler of mathematical functions into elementary chemical reactions. We illustrate the reaction code generated by our compiler on trigonometric functions, and on various sigmoid functions which can serve as markers of presence or absence for implementing program control instructions in the cell and imperative programs. Then we start comparing our compiler-generated circuits to the natural circuit of the MAPK signaling network, which plays the role of an analog-digital converter in the cell with a Hill type sigmoid input/output functions.},

A complex system is composed of many simple individual components that interact nonlinearly, giving rise to global behaviors and often unexpected, unprecedented and unpredictable that exhibit nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors. In this context, a sub-domain has emerged under the name “complex adaptive systems: CAS”. This current coming from the developments in evolutionary algorithms in 1980 years, focused on complex systems in relation with an environment in which they dynamically learn and adapt. The goal of this work is to explore the Complex system theory through a comprehensive survey, which clearly shows the properties, the mechanisms, the applications, and the different scientific currents that are related to the complex systems from 1940 until 2015.We present the effective approach for modeling and simulating complex systems. We undertake a fairly exhaustive and rigorous survey of applications of complex theory in various domains of science.},

	abstract = {This chapter outlines current perspectives on language conceived of as a ‘Complex Adaptive System’. A complex system is composed of diverse and autonomous parts that are interrelated and interdependent. With a view to circumscribing research on grammar under the scope of Complexity Theories, the notion of system is introduced along with core concepts in Ecological Linguistics, such as dynamic systems, emergentism and affordance, interacting agents and environment, adaptation and variation. Systems thinking has been a central issue in many diverse disciplines since Whitehead’s Process Philosophy. A general science of organized complexity turned into a robust General Systems Theory thanks to Von Bertalanffy, Weiss, Boulding and Prigogine who, among others, offered detailed studies on emergentism in both the natural and the social sciences. In the 1980s the Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico, elaborated a theoretical framework for complex systems that represents a solid basis for an entirely new approach to the study of organizational behaviours between the entities constituting different types of systems. Complexity research shed new light onto the study of language as a Complex Adaptive System that links the two realms of nature and culture. Language is a system composed of many speaking agents that linguistically interact in their speech communities and overtime their communicative interactions produce emergent changes at many different levels of the linguistic system. As it happens in the natural world where small organisms reorganise themselves into more complex systems, a form of ‘emergentism’ occurs in grammar, which is not an inventory of steady rules, but an ever-changing by-product of communication, whereby systematic linguistic patterns are the outcome of a process of ‘sedimentation’ of frequently used forms. Language is thus always provisional, subject to negotiation and change, an open-ended set of forms that actual use constantly restructures and resemanticizes, and it is therefore constantly far from completeness and stabilization.},

This review is formed according to the related experience, activity and scientific interests of the author, namely focused on mainly in nonlinear time series analysis and statistics and their applications on different physical systems. In particular, rough outlines are given concerning the phenomenology of complex systems, e.g. far from equilibrium thermodynamics and Tsallis statistics, power law scaling, multi-fractality, low dimensional chaos, SOC, strange kinetics and anomalous diffusion and turbulent intermittency. In addition, a non-complete list of models, based on equations or agent based, is briefly described such as Kuramoto – Sivashinsky equation, cubic complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation, reaction-diffusion Equation, fractional equations, cellular automata, complex networks and artificial neural networks. A more extended review is provided concerning the nonlinear time series analysis complex systems, describing tools like mutual information, flatness coefficient, structure functions, Tsallis q-triplet, correlation dimension and Lyapunov exponents in the reconstructed phase space, which can provide valuable information for the complex system’s dynamics. Finally, applications of nonlinear time series analysis on various physical systems, such as earthquakes, Earth’s magnetosphere, solar plasma and solar wind, plastic deformation of materials, epilepsy, economical indices and DNA structure, are provided.},

A variety of computational systems exhibit dynamics at the “edge of chaos”, the transition between the ordered and chaotic regimes. In this work, we examine the evolved neural networks of Polyworld, an artiﬁcial life model consisting of a simulated ecology populated with biologically inspired agents. As these agents adapt to their environment, their initially simple neural networks become increasingly capable of exhibiting rich dynamics. Dynamical systems analysis reveals that natural selection drives these networks toward the edge of chaos until the agent population is able to sustain itself. After this point, the evolutionary trend stabilizes, with neural dynamics remaining on average signiﬁcantly far from the transition to chaos.},

	abstract = {Previously referred to as ‘miraculous’ in the scientiﬁc literature because of its powerful properties and its wide application as optimal solution to the problem of induction/inference, (approximations to) Algorithmic Probability (AP) and the associated Universal Distribution are (or should be) of the greatest importance in science. Here we investigate the emergence, the rates of emergence and convergence, and the Coding-theorem like behaviour of AP in Turing-subuniversal models of computation. We investigate empirical distributions of computing models in the Chomsky hierarchy. We introduce measures of algorithmic probability and algorithmic complexity based upon resource-bounded computation, in contrast to previously thoroughly investigated distributions produced from the output distribution of Turing machines. This approach allows for numerical approximations to algorithmic (Kolmogorov-Chaitin) complexity-based estimations at each of the levels of a computational hierarchy. We demonstrate that all these estimations are correlated in rank and that they converge both in rank and values as a function of computational power, despite fundamental diﬀerences between computational models. In the context of natural processes that operate below the Turing universal level because of ﬁnite resources and physical degradation, the investigation of natural biases stemming from algorithmic rules may shed light on the distribution of outcomes. We show that up to 60\% of the simplicity/complexity bias in distributions produced even by the weakest of the computational models can be accounted for by Algorithmic Probability in its approximation to the Universal Distribution.},

This short review aims to provide a compact overview of the main dimensions over which the debate has unfolded and to discuss some representative examples. It focuses on those situations in which consensus emerges 'spontaneously' in absence of centralised institutions and covers topic that include the macroscopic consequences of the different microscopic rules of behavioural contagion, the role of social networks, and the mechanisms that prevent the formation of a consensus or alter it after it has emerged. Special attention is devoted to the recent wave of experiments on the emergence of consensus in social systems.},

The collective interests need to survive the turbulent dynamics of social and ecological interactions. To see how different systems with different sets of interactions have different degrees of robustness, we need to look at their different contingent histories. We analyze abstract artificial life models of such systems, and note that some prominent examples rely on explicitly ahistorical frameworks; we point out where analyses that ignore a contingent historical context can be fatally flawed. The mathematical foundations of Gaia theory are presented in a form whose very basic and general assumptions point to wide applicability across complex dynamical systems. This highlights surprising connections between robustness and accumulated contingent happenstance, regardless of whether Darwinian evolution is or is not implicated. Real-life studies highlight the role of history, and artificial life studies should do likewise.},

	abstract = {Life evolved on our planet by means of a combination of Darwinian selection and innovations leading to higher levels of complexity. The emergence and selection of replicating entities is a central problem in prebiotic evolution. Theoretical models have shown how populations of different types of replicating entities exclude or coexist with other classes of replicators. Models are typically kinetic, based on standard replicator equations. On the other hand, the presence of thermodynamical constrains for these systems remain an open question. This is largely due to the lack of a general theory of out of statistical methods for systems far from equilibrium. Nonetheless, a first approach to this problem has been put forward in a series of novel developements in non-equilibrium physics, under the rubric of the extended second law of thermodynamics. The work presented here is twofold: firstly, we review this theoretical framework and provide a brief description of the three fundamental replicator types in prebiotic evolution: parabolic, malthusian and hyperbolic. Finally, we employ these previously mentioned techinques to explore how replicators are constrained by thermodynamics.},

	abstract = {Sustainability challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, poverty and rapid urbanization are complex and strongly interrelated. In order to successfully deal with these challenges, we need comprehensive approaches that integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines and perspectives and emphasize interconnections. In short, they aid in observing matters in a wider perspective without losing an understanding of the details. In order to teach and learn a comprehensive approach, we need to better understand what comprehensive thinking actually is. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for a comprehensive approach, termed the GHH framework. The framework comprises three dimensions: generalism, holism, and holarchism. It contributes to the academic community’s understanding of comprehensive thinking and it can be used for integrating comprehensive thinking into education. Also, practical examples of the application of the framework in university teaching are presented. We argue that an ideal approach to sustainability challenges and complexity in general is a balanced, dialectical combination of comprehensive and differentiative approaches. The current dominance of specialization, or the differentiative approach, in university education calls for a stronger emphasis on comprehensive thinking skills. Comprehensiveness should not be considered as a ﬂawed approach, but should instead be considered as important an aspect in education as specialized and differentiative skills.},

We develop two agent-based models of cooperative interactions among aggressive agents threatening each other. In Model , we show that aggressive displays performed by dominance-seeking individuals create a system of mutual threats that e ectively enforces cooperation and inhibits agents from escalating conflicts. This happens because agents observe each other fighting, which deters them from attacking each other due to aggressive reputations. In Model we extend this e ect to third-party interventions showing that forming alliances makes attacks more e icient and promotes the emergence of common rules determining whom to fight against. In such a state, social order is maintained by the existence of moral alliances – groups of agents willing to fight against norm violators. In summary, we argue that reputation for toughness and the aggressive predisposition of humans could have played an important role in the evolution of cooperation and moral systems.},

	abstract = {Many living and non-living complex systems can be modeled and understood as collective systems made of heterogeneous components that self-organize and generate nontrivial morphological structures and behaviors. This chapter presents a brief overview of our recent eﬀort that investigated various aspects of such morphogenetic collective systems. We ﬁrst propose a theoretical classiﬁcation scheme that distinguishes four complexity levels of morphogenetic collective systems based on the nature of their components and interactions. We conducted a series of computational experiments using a self-propelled particle swarm model to investigate the eﬀects of (1) heterogeneity of components, (2) diﬀerentiation/re-diﬀerentiation of components, and (3) local information sharing among components, on the self-organization of a collective system. Results showed that (a) heterogeneity of components had a strong impact on the system’s structure and behavior, (b) dynamic diﬀerentiation/re-diﬀerentiation of components and local information sharing helped the system maintain spatially adjacent, coherent organization, (c) dynamic diﬀerentiation/re-diﬀerentiation contributed to the development of more diverse structures and behaviors, and (d) stochastic re-diﬀerentiation of components naturally realized a self-repair capability of self-organizing morphologies. We also explored evolutionary methods to design novel self-organizing patterns, using interactive evolutionary computation and spontaneous evolution within an artiﬁcial ecosystem. These self-organizing patterns were found to be remarkably robust against dimensional changes from 2D to 3D, although evolution worked eﬃciently only in 2D settings.},

The pattern of distribution of tumor cells is drafted on the basis of clinical observations. The stability of the system is established with tumor and tumor-free equilibria. The process of tumor regression with the introduction of different diffusion coeﬃcients of tumor and immune cells is considered along with normal cells of tissue without any diffusive movement. It is shown that the results of chemotherapy treatment are in agreement with Jeff’s phenomenon. The response of three different levels of immune system strength to the pulsed chemotherapy are investigated. It is observed that the tumor performs better if a chemotherapeutic drug is injected near the invasive fronts of the tumor.},

Among the significant new features are: - Markov-chain simulation (Sections 1. 3, 2. 6, 3. 6, 4. 3, 5. 4. 5, and 5. 5)' - gradient estimation (Sections 1. 6, 2. 5, and 4. 9)' - better handling of asynchronous observations (Sections 3. 3 and 3. 6)' - radically updated treatment of indirect estimation (Section 3. 3)' - new section on standardized time series (Section 3. 8)' - better way to generate random integers (Section 6. 7. 1) and fractions (Appendix L, program UNIFL)' - thirty-seven new problems plus improvements of old problems. Helpful comments by Peter Glynn, Barry Nelson, Lee Schruben, and Pierre Trudeau stimulated several changes. Our new random integer routine extends ideas of Aarni Perko. Our new random fraction routine implements Pierre L'Ecuyer's recommended composite generator and provides seeds to produce disjoint streams. We thank Springer-Verlag and its late editor, Walter Kaufmann-Bilhler, for inviting us to update the book for its second edition. Working with them has been a pleasure. Denise St-Michel again contributed invaluable text-editing assistance. Preface to the First Edition Simulation means driving a model of a system with suitable inputs and observing the corresponding outputs. It is widely applied in engineering, in business, and in the physical and social sciences.},

We consider the classical elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic linear equations, but also the diffusion, transport, and Navier-Stokes equations, as well as equations representing conservation laws, saddle-point problems and optimal control problems. Furthermore, we provide numerous physical examples which underline such equations. We then analyze numerical solution methods based on finite elements, finite differences, finite volumes, spectral methods and domain decomposition methods, and reduced basis methods. In particular, we discuss the algorithmic and computer implementation aspects and provide a number of easy-to-use programs. The text does not require any previous advanced mathematical knowledge of partial differential equations: the absolutely essential concepts are reported in a preliminary chapter. It is therefore suitable for students of bachelor and master courses in scientific disciplines, and recommendable to those researchers in the academic and extra-academic domain who want to approach this interesting branch of applied mathematics --},

With ever-increasing capabilities in the visualization and manipulation of biological systems, research on the fundamental phenomena, models, measurements, and analysis of complex fluids has taken a number of exciting directions. In this book, many of the world?s foremost experts explore key topics such as: Macro- and micro-rheological techniques for measuring the material properties of complex biofluids and the subtleties of data interpretation Experimental observations and rheology of complex biological materials, including mucus, cell membranes, the cytoskeleton, and blood The motility of microorganisms in complex fluids and the dynamics of active suspensions Challenges and solutions in the numerical simulation of biologically relevant complex fluid flows This volume will be accessible to advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in engineering, mathematics, biology, and the physical sciences, but will appeal to anyone interested in the intricate and beautiful nature of complex fluids in the context of living systems},

We are particularly interested in one of its variants, that is, a Gauss-type predator–prey model that includes the Allee eﬀect and Holling type-III functional response. Instead of using classic ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations to formulate the model, fractional order diﬀerential equations are utilized. The existence and uniqueness of a nonnegative solution as well as the conditions for the existence of equilibrium points are provided. We then investigate the local stability of the three types of equilibrium points by using the linearization method. The conditions for the existence of a Hopf bifurcation at the positive equilibrium are also presented. To further aﬃrm the theoretical results, numerical simulations for the coexistence equilibrium point are carried out.},

	abstract = {This paper provides an easy to follow tutorial on the free-energy framework for modelling perception developed by Friston, which extends the predictive coding model of Rao and Ballard. These models assume that the sensory cortex infers the most likely values of attributes or features of sensory stimuli from the noisy inputs encoding the stimuli. Remarkably, these models describe how this inference could be implemented in a network of very simple computational elements, suggesting that this inference could be performed by biological networks of neurons. Furthermore, learning about the parameters describing the features and their uncertainty is implemented in these models by simple rules of synaptic plasticity based on Hebbian learning. This tutorial introduces the free-energy framework using very simple examples, and provides step-by-step derivations of the model. It also discusses in more detail how the model could be implemented in biological neural circuits. In particular, it presents an extended version of the model in which the neurons only sum their inputs, and synaptic plasticity only depends on activity of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons.},

	abstract = {The utilisation of the ecospace and the change in diversity through time has been suggested to be due to the effect of niche partitioning, as a global long-term pattern in the fossil record. However, niche partitioning, as a way to coexist, could be a limited means to share the environmental resources and condition during evolutionary time. In fact, a physical limit impedes a high partitioning without a high restriction of the niche’s variables. Here, we propose that niche emergence, rather than niche partitioning, is what mostly drives ecological diversity. In particular, we view ecosystems in terms of autocatalytic sets: catalytically closed and selfsustaining reaction (or interaction) networks. We provide some examples of such ecological autocatalytic networks, how this can give rise to an expanding process of niche emergence (both in time and space), and how these networks have evolved over time (so-called evoRAFs). Furthermore, we use the autocatalytic set formalism to show that it can be expected to observe a power-law in the size distribution of extinction events in ecosystems. In short, we elaborate on our earlier argument that new species create new niches, and that biodiversity is therefore an autocatalytic process.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics have led to a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic cost of computation than that put forth by Landauer and then studied extensively in the computational complexity community. In particular, Landauer’s work led to a focus on the number of bit erasures in a computation, due to its relation to the change in entropy between input and output. However new advances in physics—which have been experimentally conﬁrmed—mean we can now calculate additional thermodynamic costs beyond merely the change in entropy between input and output. As a consequence, we now understand that while logically reversible computing can have some thermodynamic beneﬁts, it is far from the end of the story. The purpose of this paper is to highlight new open questions in computational complexity raised by consideration of these new thermodynamic costs. Beyond leading to a revised viewpoint on the beneﬁts of logical reversibility, these questions touch on randomized algorithms, average-case complexity, the thermodynamic cost of error correcting codes, and noisy/inexact/approximate computation.},

Here we report on a preliminary study of swarm collisions for a swarm model in which each agent is self-propelling but globally communicates with other agents. We generalize previous models by investigating the interacting dynamics when delay is introduced to the communicating agents. One of our major ﬁndings is that interacting swarms are far less likely to ﬂock cohesively if they are coupled with delay. In addition, parameter ranges based on coupling strength, incidence angle of collision, and delay change dramatically for other swarm interactions which result in ﬂocking, milling, and scattering.},

This paper develops an axiom system to construct a weighted additive model reflecting nonconstant impatience. By presupposing that an increment in duration is subjectively assessed according to the periods at which advancement occurs, we denote the one-period advanced receipt of outcomes by multiplying the outcomes by the increment on the right. By this right multiplication, we can regard the effect of advance as the decomposition into two factors, i.e., the factor of step-by-step advance accompanied by subdivided durations and the factor of advance based on the total duration. First, the conditions for enabling right multiplication are proposed for the Cartesian product of the underlying set of a generalized extensive structure and a set of durations. Second, the properties derived under these conditions yield a right action on the generalized extensive structure. Finally, the weighted additive model is obtained as a representation of the generalized extensive structure equipped with the right action.},

More recently, however, it has been extended beyond the brain to explain the dynamics of living systems, and their unique capacity to avoid decay. The aim of this review is to synthesise these advances with a meta-theoretical ontology of biological systems called variational neuroethology, which integrates the FEP with Tinbergen’s four research questions to explain biological systems across spatial and temporal scales. We exemplify this framework by applying it to Homo sapiens, before translating variational neuroethology into a systematic research heuristic that supplies the biological, cognitive, and social sciences with a computationally tractable guide to discovery.},

This article lays the foundation for an integrative model that captures interaction between these components. The underlying fundamentals of the proposed model hinges on the principle of a damped harmonic oscillator by assuming the behavior of a community in response to a hazard is equivalent to the response of a vibrating mass of ﬁnite stiffness and damping. We implemented the dynamic model by developing a novel ﬁnite element formulation capable of quantifying resilience both temporally and spatially. We then used the developed model to devise a suitable hazard-agnostic deﬁnition of community resilience. This was realized through a set of demonstration and logical veriﬁcation tests conducted on Gotham City, the ﬁctional city of the infamous character, Batman. It was observed that the model can be used to identify sensitive and vulnerable areas in a community, provide a spatial and temporal quantiﬁcation of community resilience, and accommodate various types of hazards such as physical disruptions, economic downtimes, and even social disorders.},

	abstract = {The focus of this article is to investigate the biological reference points, such as the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), in a common Schaefer (logistic) surplus production model in the presence of a multiplicative environmental noise. This type of model is used in ﬁsheries stock assessment as a ﬁrsthand tool for biomass modelling. Under the assumption that catches are proportional to the biomass, we derive new conditions on the environmental noise distribution such that stationarity exists and extinction is avoided. We then get new explicit results about the stationary behavior of the biomass distribution for a particular speciﬁcation of the noise, namely the biomass distribution itself and a redeﬁnition of the MSY and related quantities that now depend on the value of the variance of the noise. Consequently, we obtain a more precise vision of how less optimistic the stochastic version of the MSY can be than the traditionally used (deterministic) MSY. In addition, we give empirical conditions on the error variance to approximate our speciﬁc noise by a lognormal noise, the latter being more natural and leading to easier inference in this context. These conditions are mild enough to make the explicit results of this paper valid in a number of practical applications.

Particularly, agent-based models (ABMs) represent a method of investigation of social phenomena that blend the knowledge of social sciences with the advantages of virtual simulations. Within this context, the development of algorithms able to recreate the reasoning engine of autonomous virtual agents represents one of the most fragile aspects and it is indeed crucial to establish such models on well-supported psychological theoretical frameworks. For this reason, the present work discusses the application case of the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) in the context of agent-based modeling: It is argued that this framework might be helpful more than others to develop a valid representation of human behavior in computer simulations. Accordingly, the current contribution considers issues related with the application of the model proposed by the TPB inside computer simulations and suggests potential solutions with the hope to contribute to shorten the distance between the fields of psychology and computer science.},

The ejection chain perspective motivating the new neighborhoods diﬀers from that underlying the most general assignment-based neighborhoods proposed in the past, giving rise to new tour constructions that encompass and go beyond previous proposals. The resulting neighborhoods provide greater ﬂexibility for generating new tours while simultaneously accounting for sparse traveling salesman graphs that were previously omitted from consideration. Finally, our approaches are applicable for improving the solution of some versions of the vehicle routing problem.},

The incentives are usually modeled by payoﬀs in strategical games, such as the prisoner’s dilemma or the harmony game. Adjusting the incentives by changing the payoﬀ parameters e.g. through tax schemes can favor cooperation (harmony) over defection (prisoner’s dilemma). Here, we show that if individuals engage in strategic interactions in multiple domains, incentives can fail and the ﬁnal outcome, cooperation or defection, is dominated by the initial state of the system. Our ﬁndings highlight the importance to take the multilayer structure of human interactions into account and emphasize the importance to rethink payoﬀ-based incentives.},

The objective of this paper is to explore the characteristics of this niche in relation to a range of existing modelling approaches and literatures with which it shares commonalities or from which it could draw. We distil a number of key aspects we think a transitions model should be able to address, from a broadly acknowledged, empirical list of transition characteristics. We review some of the main strands in modelling of socio-technological change with regards to their ability to address these characteristics. These are: Ecoinnovation literatures (energy-economy models and Integrated Assessment Models), evolutionary economics, complex systems models, computational social science simulations using agent based models, system dynamics models and socio-ecological systems models. The modelling approaches reviewed can address many of the features that di erentiate sustainability transitions from other socio-economic dynamics or innovations. The most problematic features are the representation of qualitatively di erent system states and of the normative aspects of change. The comparison provides transition researchers with a starting point for their choice of a modelling approach, whose characteristics should correspond to the characteristics of the research question they face. A promising line of research is to develop innovative models of co-evolution of behaviours and technologies towards sustainability, involving change in the structure of the societal and technical systems.},

	abstract = {Many cell functions rely on the ability of microtubules to self-organize as complex networks. In plants, cortical microtubules are essential to determine cell shape as they guide the deposition of cellulose microfibrils, and thus control mechanical anisotropy of the cell wall. Here we analyze how, in turn, cell shape may influence microtubule behavior. Buidling upon previous models that confined microtubules to the cell surface, we introduce an agent model of microtubules enclosed in a three-dimensional volume. We show that the microtubule network has spontaneous aligned configurations that could explain many experimental observations without resorting to specific regulation. In particular, we find that the preferred cortical localization of microtubules emerges from directional persistence of the microtubules, and their interactions with each other and with the stiff wall. We also identify microtubule parameters that seem relatively insensitive to cell shape, such as length or number. In contrast, microtubule array anisotropy depends on local curvature of the cell surface and global orientation follows robustly the longest axis of the cell. Lastly, we find that geometric cues may be overcome, as network is capable of reorienting toward weak external directional cues. Altogether our simulations show that the microtubule network is a good transducer of weak external polarity, while at the same time, easily reaching stable global configurations.},

	abstract = {Information dynamics is an emerging description of information processing in complex systems. In this paper we make a formal analogy between information dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics. As stochastic dynamics increasingly concerns itself with the processing of information we suggest such an analogy is instructive in providing hitherto unexplored insights into the implicit information processing that occurs in physical systems. Information dynamics describes systems in terms of intrinsic computation, identifying computational primitives of information storage and transfer. We construct irreversibility measures in terms of these quantities are relate them to the physical entropy productions that govern the behaviour of single and composite systems in stochastic thermodynamics illustrating them with simple examples. Moreover, we can apply such a formalism to systems which do not have a bipartite structure. In particular we demonstrate that, given suitable non-bipartite processes, the heat flow in a subsystem can still be identified and one requires the present formalism to recover generalisations of the second law. This opens up the possibility of describing all physical systems in terms of computation allowing us to propose a framework for discussing the reversibility of systems traditionally out of scope of stochastic thermodynamics.},
